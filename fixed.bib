abstract = {Indirect effects are important components of ecological
                  and evolutionary interactions that may maintain
                  biodiversity, enable or inhibit invasive species,
                  and challenge ecosystem assessment and management. A
                  central hypothesis of Network Environ Analysis
                  (NEA), one type of ecological network analysis, is
                  that indirect flows tend to dominate direct flows in
                  ecosystem networks of conservative substance
                  exchanges. However, current NEA methods assume that
                  these ecosystems are stationary (i.e. time invariant
                  exchange rates), which is unlikely to be true for
                  many ecosystems for interesting time and space
                  scales. For the work reported here, we investigated
                  the sensitivity of the dominance of indirect effects
                  hypothesis to the stationary modeling assumption by
                  determining the development rate of indirect effects
                  and flow intensity, as expressed as the number of
                  transfer steps, in thirty-one ecosystem models. We
                  hypothesized that indirect effects develop rapidly
                  in ecological networks, but that they would develop
                  faster in biogeochemically based models than in
                  trophically based models. In contrast, our results
                  show that indirect effects develop rapidly in all
                  thirty-one models examined. In 94\% of the models,
                  indirect flows exceeded direct flows by a pathway
                  length of 3. This indicates that ecological systems
                  do not need to maintain a particular configuration
                  for long for indirect effects to dominate. Thus, the
                  dominance of indirect effects hypothesis remains
                  plausible. We also found that biogeochemical models
                  tended to require more of the extended path network
                  than the trophic models to account for 50\% and 95\%
                  of the total system activity, but that both types of
                  models required more of the power series than is
                  typically considered in engineered systems. These
                  results succinctly illustrate the complexity of
                  ecological systems and help explain why they are
                  challenging to assess and manage.},

abstract = "Traditional evolutionary theory depicts survival of the
                  fittest as a difficult existence based on danger,
                  conflict and strife. But, another view is emerging
                  of a more synergistic organization in which
                  ecosystems on the whole provide hospitable
                  conditions for life. This world is populated by
                  organisms mutually adapted and beneficial by virtue
                  of their direct and indirect interactions. Many
                  examples of mutualism have been explicitly observed
                  (Bronstein, J.L., 1991. Bull. Ecol. Soc. Am. 72,
                  6–8; Cushman, J.H., Beattie, A.J., 1991. Trends
                  Ecol. Evol. 6, 193–195; Casti, J.L., Karlqvist,

                  Evolutionary Processes, Wiley, New York, 435 pp.),
                  and we view mutualism as an implicit consequence of
                  indirect interactions and ecosystem
                  organization. This paper extends a methodology based
                  on input-output analysis that models these
                  synergistic relationships (Patten, B.C.,
                  1991. Theoretical Studies of Ecosystems: The Network
                  Perspective, pp. 288–351; Patten, B.C.,
                  1992. Ecol. Modell. 62, 29–69). We show for simple
                  storage-flow models that direct zero-sum resource
                  transactions between organisms, when considered in
                  context of the whole-system organization, produce
                  integral (direct plus indirect) relationships more
                  positive than the direct ones. This phenomenon,
                  `network synergism', is demonstrated for two simple
                  networks and a complete three component model. We
                  also show, by looking at a limiting case, that
                  system-wide synergism is ubiquitous, occurring in
                  all models of any size or complexity. Network
                  synergism emerges in these models because of three
                  network properties: symmetry, indirectness and
                  openness."
