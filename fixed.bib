  title = "Community and ecosystem genetics: A consequence of the extended phenotype",
   abstract = "We present evidence that the heritable genetic variation within individual species, especially dominant and keystone species, has community and ecosystem consequences. These consequences represent extended phenotypes, i.e., the effects of genes at levels higher than the population. Using diverse examples from microbes to vertebrates, we demonstrate that the extended phenotype can be traced from the individuals possessing the trait, to the community, and to ecosystem processes such as leaf litter decomposition and N mineralization. In our development of a community genetics perspective, we focus on intraspecific genetic variation because the extended phenotypes of these genes can be passed from one generation to the next, which provides a mechanism for heritability. In support of this view, common-garden experiments using synthetic crosses of a dominant tree show that their progeny tend to support arthropod communities that resemble those of their parents. We also argue that the combined interactions of extended phenotypes contribute to the among-community variance in the traits of individuals within communities. The genetic factors underlying this among-community variance in trait expression, particularly those involving genetic interactions among species, constitute community heritability. These findings have diverse implications. (1) They provide a genetic framework for understanding community structure and ecosystem processes. The effects of extended phenotypes at these higher levels need not be diffuse; they may be direct or may act in relatively few steps, which enhances our ability to detect and predict their effects. (2) From a conservation perspective, we introduce the concept of the minimum viable interacting population (MVIP), which represents the size of a population needed to maintain genetic diversity at levels required by other interacting species in the community. (3) Genotype x environment interactions in dominant and keystone species can shift extended phenotypes to have unexpected consequences at community and ecosystem levels, an issue that is especially important as it relates to global change. (4) Documenting community heritability justifies a community genetics perspective and is an essential first step in demonstrating community evolution. (5) Community genetics requires and promotes an integrative approach, from genes to ecosystems, that is necessary for the marriage of ecology and genetics. Few studies span from genes to ecosystems, but such integration is probably essential for understanding the natural world.",

   title = "Deadly combination of genes and drought: Increased mortality of herbivore-resistant trees in a foundation species",
   abstract = "Current climate models predict a shift to warmer, drier conditions in the southwestern US. While major shifts in plant distribution are expected to follow these climate changes, interactions among species and intraspecific genetic variation rarely have been incorporated into models of future plant distributions. We examined the drought-related mortality of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis) in northern Arizona focusing on trees that showed genetically-based resistance or susceptibility to a nonlethal herbivore, the shoot-boring moth, Dioryctria albovittella. Because moth resistant trees have outperformed susceptible trees during 20 years of study, and herbivory has been shown to increase drought related mortality, we expected higher mortality rates in susceptible trees. However, our field observations and greenhouse experiments showed several unexpected patterns relevant to understanding the consequences of climate change: (1) The mortality of adult P. edulis resistant to the moth was three times higher than the mortality of trees susceptible to the moth. (2) Over a few years, differential mortality caused a shift in stand structure from resistant dominated to equality (3:1 resistant:susceptible to 1:1). (3) Adult moth resistant trees suffered significantly greater water stress than adult moth susceptible trees, suggesting that variation among the two groups in drought tolerance may be a mechanism for differential mortality. (4) When grown under drought conditions in the greenhouse, seedlings from resistant mothers died sooner than seedlings from susceptible mothers. These data support the hypothesis that drought can act as an agent of balancing selection and that drought resistance is a heritable trait. Taken together, our findings suggest that genetic variation in a population can be an important factor in determining its response to future climate change, and argue for the inclusion of genetics into models developed to understand the consequences of climate change.",

abstract = {Indirect effects are important components of ecological
                  and evolutionary interactions that may maintain
                  biodiversity, enable or inhibit invasive species,
                  and challenge ecosystem assessment and management. A
                  central hypothesis of Network Environ Analysis
                  (NEA), one type of ecological network analysis, is
                  that indirect flows tend to dominate direct flows in
                  ecosystem networks of conservative substance
                  exchanges. However, current NEA methods assume that
                  these ecosystems are stationary (i.e. time invariant
                  exchange rates), which is unlikely to be true for
                  many ecosystems for interesting time and space
                  scales. For the work reported here, we investigated
                  the sensitivity of the dominance of indirect effects
                  hypothesis to the stationary modeling assumption by
                  determining the development rate of indirect effects
                  and flow intensity, as expressed as the number of
                  transfer steps, in thirty-one ecosystem models. We
                  hypothesized that indirect effects develop rapidly
                  in ecological networks, but that they would develop
                  faster in biogeochemically based models than in
                  trophically based models. In contrast, our results
                  show that indirect effects develop rapidly in all
                  thirty-one models examined. In 94\% of the models,
                  indirect flows exceeded direct flows by a pathway
                  length of 3. This indicates that ecological systems
                  do not need to maintain a particular configuration
                  for long for indirect effects to dominate. Thus, the
                  dominance of indirect effects hypothesis remains
                  plausible. We also found that biogeochemical models
                  tended to require more of the extended path network
                  than the trophic models to account for 50\% and 95\%
                  of the total system activity, but that both types of
                  models required more of the power series than is
                  typically considered in engineered systems. These
                  results succinctly illustrate the complexity of
                  ecological systems and help explain why they are
                  challenging to assess and manage.},

abstract = "Traditional evolutionary theory depicts survival of the
                  fittest as a difficult existence based on danger,
                  conflict and strife. But, another view is emerging
                  of a more synergistic organization in which
                  ecosystems on the whole provide hospitable
                  conditions for life. This world is populated by
                  organisms mutually adapted and beneficial by virtue
                  of their direct and indirect interactions. Many
                  examples of mutualism have been explicitly observed
                  (Bronstein, J.L., 1991. Bull. Ecol. Soc. Am. 72,
                  6–8; Cushman, J.H., Beattie, A.J., 1991. Trends

                  and we view mutualism as an implicit consequence of
                  indirect interactions and ecosystem
                  organization. This paper extends a methodology based
                  on input-output analysis that models these
                  synergistic relationships (Patten, B.C.,
                  1991. Theoretical Studies of Ecosystems: The Network
                  Perspective, pp. 288–351; Patten, B.C.,
                  1992. Ecol. Modell. 62, 29–69). We show for simple
                  storage-flow models that direct zero-sum resource
                  transactions between organisms, when considered in
                  context of the whole-system organization, produce
                  integral (direct plus indirect) relationships more
                  positive than the direct ones. This phenomenon,
                  `network synergism', is demonstrated for two simple
                  networks and a complete three component model. We
                  also show, by looking at a limiting case, that
                  system-wide synergism is ubiquitous, occurring in
                  all models of any size or complexity. Network
                  synergism emerges in these models because of three
                  network properties: symmetry, indirectness and
                  openness."
