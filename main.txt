Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex ecosystems of
interacting species whereby natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to understanding evolutionary processes is elucidating the genetic basis to ecological network
structure, which is defined by interactions among species. Although
previous work has demonstrated that genotypic variation in foundation species contributes to interaction network structure, we are not
aware of a study that has quantified the genetic contribution to network structure or shown network structure to be a heritable trait. To
examine this, in a 20+ year common garden we observed interactions
among nine epiphytic lichen species associated with genotypes of
(Populus angustifolia), a foundation species of riparian ecosystems.
We constructed signed, weighted, directed interaction networks for
the lichens and conducted genetic analyses of whole network similarity, degree and centralization. We found three primary results.
First, using multiple metrics, tree genotype significantly predicted
lichen network structure; i.e., clonal replicates of the same genotype
tended to support more similar lichen networks than different genotypes. Second, broad sense heritability estimates show that plant
genotype explains network similarity (H 2 = 0.41), network degree
(H 2 = 0.32) and network centralization (H 2 = 0.33). Third, one of
the examined tree traits, bark roughness, was also heritable (H 2 =
0.32) and significantly correlated with lichen network similarity (R2
= 0.26), supporting a mechanistic pathway from variation in a heritable tree trait and the genetically based variation in lichen network
structure that selection can act upon. We conclude that tree genotype can influence not only the relative abundances of organisms
but also the interaction network structure of associated organisms.
Given that variation in network structure can have consequences for
the dynamics of communities through altering system-wide stability
and resilience and modulating perturbations, these results have important implications for the evolutionary dynamics of ecosystems.

Significance Statement

Evolution occurs in the context of ecosystems comprised of complex ecological networks. Research at
the interface of ecology and evolution has primarily
focused on pairwise interactions among species and
have rarely included a genetic component to network structure. Here, we used a 20+ year common
garden experiment to reveal the effect that genotypic variation can have on networks of lichens that
colonize the bark of a foundation tree species. We
found that lichen interaction network structure is genetically based and primarily driven by bark roughness. These findings demonstrate the importance
of genetic variation and evolutionary dynamics in
shaping ecological networks as evolved traits. In
particular, this study points to the importance of assessing the effect of foundation species genetics on
the structure of species interactions that can generate heritable network variation that selection can
act upon.

Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a
foundation tree species determines the structure of
a network of interactions among a community of
tree associated lichen species. Previous studies have
examined aspects of networks (33). Here we examine
the genetic basis of network structure on a community of sessile lignicolous (i.e., bark) lichens on
cottonwood trees. Using a long-term (20+ years),
common garden experiment with clonally replicated
Populus angustifolia individuals of known genetic
identity . We focused on a community of 9 epiphytic
lichen species, as previous research has demonstrated
significant compositional responses of epiphytes to
genotypic variation (34, 35). In addition, the lifehistory characteristics of lichens, having highly localized, direct contact interactions and slow population
turnover rates, facilitated the assessment of interactions among lichen species on individual trees. We
hypothesize that in natural systems evolution occurs
in a community context involving interactions of complex networks of interacting species (23, 24, 36, 37).
If correct, we expect to find that network structure
is genetically based, or, in other words, plant genotypes will support different and heritable interaction
networks. Applying a probability-theory based network modeling approach, we constructed a set of
interaction network models for the lichens associated
with individual trees. Using these models, we then
examined the genetic basis of the structure of these
ecological networks via several network metrics that
measures different aspects of network structure at
the scale of individual species (i.e., nodes) or the
entire network observed on each tree genotype. In
particular, we focus the metric of centrality for individual species and centralization for whole networks,
which measures how much a species is connected
in the network relative to other species. Based on
previous community genetics theory, particularly the
community similarity rule (16), we hypothesize that
trees will co-vary in functional phenotypic traits such
as bark roughness and chemical composition and
trees of the same genotype will tend to have similar
traits leading to similarities in lichen network structure. This work is important because it provides a
mechanistic basis for understanding how community

network theory is intimately associated with the evolutionary process and how human alterations of the
environment (e.g., climate change, invasive species,
pollution) may have cascading, indirect effects that
alter network structure and evolution.

Study System. The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a cottonwood (Populus
spp.) dominated riparian ecosystem. Although two native
species, Populus angustifolia (James) and Populus fremontii (S. Watson), occur here and are known to hybridize,
only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of P. angustifolia were sampled. Bark lichens have been extensively
studied in this system and provide an ideal system in
which to observe and model lichen interaction networks,
as their sessile nature permits accurate identification of
individuals (38).
A long-term, common garden experiment was used
to isolate the effect of tree genotype from the effect of
the localized microenvironment associated with each individual and spatial autocorrelation. Established in 1992,
asexually propagated clones of genotyped P. angustifolia individuals were obtained from wild collections and
planted in fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature
Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established
individuals in the common garden, we chose a total of
ten genotypes, replicated between 3 and 8 times each, for
sampling.

Bark Lichen and Trait Observations. On each tree, pres-

ence or absence of each lichen species was assessed in 50
total 1 cm2 cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichens, we were able to
rapidly assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in
close contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk to maximize the abundance of lichen and
control for the effect of trunk aspect. Two adjacent 100
cm2 quadrats centered at 50 cm and 95 cm from ground
level were sampled (Fig 1 A and B). The observed lichen
community included (abbreviations are given for species
present in study): Xg = Xanthomendoza galericulata, Xm
= X. montana, Ch = Caloplaca holocarpa, Cs = Candelariella subdeflexa, Rg = Rinodina glauca, Lh = Lecanora
hagenii, Pm = Phyciella melanchra, Pa = Physcia adscendens, Pu = Physcia undulata. Several other species were
not obesrved in the present study but are known to occur
in this region: Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Phaeophyscia
ciliata, Melanelia subolivacea, Meanelia elegantula.
The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was
chosen to isolate the individuals in each cell. In a previous
survey of lichen thallus size in this common garden, we
had observed a median thallus size of 0.12 ± 0.001 cm2 (1

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove
non-significant links between species. This procedure
determines if the joint probability of a species pair
(i.e. P (Si , Sj )) is different from zero (Fig. 2). Here, a
confidence intervalpCI95% is calculated as as CI95% =
E[Si Sj ] ∗ Z95% ∗ V (Si Sj ), where the expected frequency of co-occurrences E(Si Sj ) is the total number
of cells surveyed (N ) times the independent probabilities of each species P (Si ) ∗ P (Sj ), Z95% is the Z-score
for 95% from a Z-distribution and the expected variance of E(Si Sj ) is the total number of cells times the
expected probability of Si Sj and its compliment (i.e.
V (Si Sj ) = N ∗ E[P (Si , Sj )] ∗ (1 − E[P (Si , Sj )])). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the
confidence interval, the joint probability P (Si , Sj ) is determined to be equal to the product of the individual
probabilities (i.e. P (Si )Ṗ (Sj )), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual probability of that species
P (Si ). Therefore, unless the co-occurrence of a species
pair falls outside the confidence interval, the probability that the observation of one species given the other
is no different than simply observing that species alone.
This enables us to remove links from a given network by
re-scaling the resulting conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities from the conditional
probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional probability
is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero.
The resulting matrix (D = Dij ) can be interpreted as
how one species impacts another with zero being no effect
and values less than or greater than zero interpreted as
negative and positive effects, respectively. Here, we will
refer to this matrix (D) as an interaction matrix with
the properties that it can be asymetric (i.e. Pij does not
necessarily equal Pji ), and the diagonal (Pii ) is zero (i.e.
a species does not influence it’s own probability of being
observed).

developed by (39) with the addition that we quantified
the presence of lichen in the 1 cm2 cells on individual
trees of P. angustifolia. Unipartite networks were generated using the conditional probabilities of each species
pair, i.e. the probability of observing one species given
an observation of another species P (Si |Sj ), based on
the method developed by (40). To calculate conditional
probabilities, we quantified the individual probabilities
of species occurrences P (Si ) and the joint probability
of co-occurrences P (Si , Sj ) using the frequencies of each
species and their co-occurrences. We were then able to
calculate the conditional probabilities of each species pair
P (Si ,Sj )
as P (Si |Sj ) = P (S
, based on the axioms of probability.

This yielded a matrix that could possibly be asymetric, i.e.
P (Si |Sj ) does not have to be equal to P (Sj |Si ). Another
important property of this matrix is that the diagonal
(Sii ) was equal to one for all species present and zero for
species that were not observed in any cell.

thallus size, we expected thalli observed in each cell to
generally be spatially independent of thalli present in
other cells but exposed to similar micro-environmental
conditions created by the bark and the location of the
sampling area on an individual tree. Therefore, we were
confident in treating the cell-wise observations in quadrats
as independent with respect to lichen-lichen interactions.
We quantified the texture of the bark in the quadrat is
the percent of 1 cm2 cells with rough bark. In addition to
bark roughness, we also measured several bark chemistry
traits by taking bark samples immediately adjacent to
each quadrat using the methods of (38): including, the
concentration of condensed tannin, pH and carbon and
nitrogen concentrations and pH.

Fig. 2. Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting field observations in 1 cm2 cells within a 100 cm2 grid on each tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey
cells). Thus, a set of N total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying the probability-based
network modeling method adapted from (40), we calculated the conditional probabilities, P (Si |Sj ), for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to zero) species pairs
whose joint probabilities, P (Si Sj ), were not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of their observed co-occurrence frequency, Si Sj , to that expected
due to chance alone, E[P (Si Sj )] = P (Si )P (Sj ), and P (Si |Sj ) reduces to P (Si ), the observed individual probability of species Si . In the context of these networks,
asymetry and positive/negative valued connections are distinct quantities. In-coming and out-going connections can be interpreted as “influenced by” and “influenced”,
respectively; while positive and negative should be seen as one species increasing or decreasing, respectively, the probability of another species’ occurrence.

Network Metrics. To quantify the structural variation of

291

lichen networks we calculated several metrics at both the
node and whole-network level. For individual nodes (i.e.
species) in each network, we calculated both the degree
and the Freeman’s centrality (41). We also calculated two
similar global network metrics: degree and centralization.
The first was network degree, which is a count of the
total number of links in a network. As the networks
contained not only positive and negative connections,
as well as directional connections (both in-coming and
out-going), we calculated the same network metrics for
all combinations of these types of connections in each
network. Although there are many more possible network
metrics that could have been examined, we chose to focus
on a restricted set for the sake of clarity. Also, degree and
centrality form the basis of many other network metrics.

Statistical Analyses, Software and Data. We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects
of genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we used additive, random effects models
with Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML). We used
a combination of Least Squares Regression, Analysis of
Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark
roughness, lichen cover and species richness were squareroot transformed to meet the assumptions of homogeneity
of variance and normality for these tests.

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate statistical approaches, including
Permutational Analysis of Variance (PERMANOVA) and

Fig. 3. Lichen networks varied in structure among tree genotypes. Network diagrams of the mean lichen interaction matrices averaged for all trees and for several
individual genotypes (996, WC5 and 1008) showing a range of interaction network
structure. Directionality (arrowheads) and sign (red = negative, black = positive) of
interactions are shown as edges between species (abbreviated by the first letter of
the genus and specific epithet), which are scaled by their magnitude. The sign of the
interaction is indicative of greater (positive) or lesser (negative) paired occurrences
than expected relative to the overall frequency of occurrence of each species. Ecologically, the links in the network are likely the product of multiple types of interactions
(e.g. mutualism, parasatism, competition, facilitation) that could vary over both space
and time.

For each network, we also calculated metrics that measure different structural aspects. Although there are many
other metrics, for the sake of simplicity we focus on a
subset that represent several interesting features of network structure (see (17)). We calculated the number of
interactions or “links” in each network, which provides a
measure of the size of the network (23, 46). We also calculated the centralization of each network, which measures
the evenness of the distribution of interactions among
the species in the network (41). In a network with a
low level of centralization species have similar amount of
interaction in the network, while a network with a high
level of centralization tends to have one or small number
of species that interact with other species. We used a
related function to calculate the centrality of each species
(i.e. node level centrality) in each network as well.

For all tests where genotype was used as a predictor,
we quantified the heritability of the response variable. Because the trees in the garden were clonal replicates of each
genotype, we calculated broad-sense heritability, which
is the genotypic variance divided by the total phenotypic
variance (47). This can be interpreted as a measure of
the phenotypic variance due to genotypic variation. We
also apply this to the community genetics context as the
variance in extended phenotypic variance due to genotypic
variation (48). For the multivariate analyses, where we
employ PERMANOVA, we followed the methods of (27)
to adjust the degrees of freedom for unbalanced genotype
replicates.

Tree genotype influenced lichen network structure
and multiple lichen network metrics were heritable. Tree genotype significantly predicted the structural similarity of lichen networks (PERMANOVA:
Pseudo-F9,27 = 3.58, H 2 = 0.41, p-value = 0.0537)
(Fig. 4). Overall network level metrics responded
signficantly to tree genotype (Table 1), including network degree (RLRT = 3.52, H 2 = 0.32, p-value =
0.0255) and centralization including both in-coming
and out-going links (RLRT = 4.04, H 2 = 0.33, pvalue = 0.0184) or when separated into in-coming
only (RLRT = 3.9852, H 2 = 0.3309, p-value =
0.0190) or out-going only (RLRT = 3.8615, H 2 =
0.3193, p-value = 0.0205). Metrics including only
positive links also showed a signficant effect of tree
genotype, including positive degree (RLRT = 3.6925,
H 2 = 0.3242, p-value = 0.0229), positive in-going
centralization (RLRT = 4.4812, H 2 = 0.3487, pvalue = 0.0142) Metrics calculated with negative
links were not significant, including degree (negative)

Heritability of Interaction Network Structure. We
found significant heritability of lichen interaction
network structure, and, in line with the genetic similarity rule, networks observed on trees of the same
genotype tended to be structurally similar. There
are important functional ramifications of genetically
based variation in network structure. First, even
if the composition of the communities is the same
among individuals and genotypes, interactions may
not be. We didn’t observe compositional differences
using the same data from which the lichen networks
were derived. If we only had our composition dataset
from this study, we would have concluded no response of the lichen community to tree genotype,
even though the underlying interactions among lichen
species does vary among genotypes. Community composition of lichen has previously been observed to
be different among tree genotype in the same experimental garden, though this was observed with a
larger sampling of total area and quadrats per tree.
Regardless, this could result in a situtation in which
abundance based investigations of community-level
genetic effects may miss important variation in the
interactions among individuals in these communities, leading to an underestimate of genetic effects
in ecosystems. It is possible that these underlying
differences in interactions among lichen could lead

to differences in community composition at a future point in time, however, this is not needed for
evolutionary dynamics to play out.
Second, following on the previous point, genetic
diversity could be influencing the stability of communities through the effects on the structure of interactions. Some network structures are likely to be
more stable, either in response to disturbance or via
self-organized dynamics. For example, centralized
networks, although more effecient, are theorized to
be more susceptible to targeted attacks on the center
of the network. For example, consider a forest with
two genotypes that support lichen communities that
are similar in total abundances of each species but
differ in terms of the structure. Extensions of game
theory to evolutionary biology have demonstrated
that network structure can lead to variation in evolutionary dynamics. Some structures tend toward
dominance and dampening of selection, while others
lead to amplification of selection (Newman). One
class of networks that are theorized to have amplifying effects on networks have "star" shapes with one or
a few species at the center and radiating interactions
out from the central core (Leiberman). This is structurally what we have observed with the networks that
tend to occur on some of the genotypes in our study,
i.e. the more centralized networks. It is possible that

Implications for Interspecific Indirect Genetic Effects (IIGEs). Interspecific indirect genetic effects

(IIGE) theory provides a quantitative framework
within which to approach evolutionary theory at
higher levels of biological organization: from populations to communities and ecosystems. To date,
this theory has focused on modeling the strong effects of foundation species (7, 27), but it has not
yet integrated developments in the ecological or evolutionary network theory literature. This is to say
that it has not developed a way to examine complex interactions among species; however, previous
studies have demonstrated this network context is
likely to be important, as altering the structure of
interaction networks provides a means for genetic
effects to be dampened or magnified within the system of interacting species. For example, (24) showed
that the genetics based interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible trees resulted in different
interaction networks of their associated arthropod
communities composed of 139 species. At the scale
of ecosystems, trophic networks or food webs direct
and control the rates of energy and nutrient flux (50).
Furthermore, in a predator-prey-plant study, Smith
(20), showed that the interactions among species
across trophic levels depended on plant genotype.
Also, work by (51–53) observed consistent patterns
of centralized interactions of species modules focused
around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts
tended to have disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and likely are the drivers
in determining community assembly, structure and
dynamics.
The results of the current study provides clear emprical evidence that variation in network structure
can be genetically based (i.e. heritable) and points to
the need to expand IIGEs encompass the structure
of interaction networks. Although such a synthesis
necessitates a much greater effort than can be afforded in this paper, it is possible to point to several
productive pathways forward. In terms of interaction
networks, foundation species are relatively central
within the system of interactions, that is their direct
and/or indirect effects are greater then other species.

So, when the more centralized (foundation) species
have genetically based interactions, genetic effects
will tend to be magnified in the community. Here,
we found that even though more abundant or more
centralized (i.e. “important”) species were present in
the community, their effects were not the main component responding to genetic effects. Considering
the impact of network structure would be a productive path forward for the theoretical development
and application of the IIGE concept.
Evolutionary Implications of a Genetic Basis to
Network Structure. With regard to the evolution-

ary implications of network structure, ecological network studies have focused on asymmetry and the
quantification of its structure in communities, with
qualiltative discussion of the impacts on evolutionary
dynamics (36, 37, 54, 55). More specific predications,
with a quantiative framework, can be found in applications of evolutionary game theory, and although
developed at the population scale, such theory can
apply to communities. One seemingly useful direction from evolutionary network developments from
game theory is the classification of networks into two
genreal categories, rooted and cyclic, in which rooted
networks have interactions in which evolutionary effects emanate from one or multiple origins but these
effects do not have connections back to the origins,
whereas cyclic networks contain feedbacks to one or
more origins. Although it did not explicitely define it
in this context, the previous work of (17) developed
the perspective that the structure of the network in
the context of a foundation species, such as cottonwoods in which there are demonstrable community
level genetic effects, is inherently created when trait
variation among genotypes of a foundation species
has ecological effects on associated species.
This builds on many previous studies demonstrating that the community level effects vary among
multiple genotypes. It is not clear what potential
there is for feedbacks there are to the origins (e.g. the
cottonwood genotypes) from the community, and as
such it cannot be determined whether these networks
are cyclic or rooted. In other systems, lignicolous
lichens can have demonstrable positive effects on the
availability of nutrients for the trees that they are
associated with, but this has not been measured in
the current system. Illucidating the absence and/or
presence and quantifying such feedbacks would allow for the determination of the cyclic nature and

these more centralized networks could function as
hot-spots of evolutionary dynamics resulting from
the amplifying effect the network structure fostered
on that tree genotype.

potential evolutionary dynamics of this system. The
presence of feedbacks would provide the potential
for non-linear dynamics in which evolutionary effects
are dampened or amplified by the struture of the network. For example, a star structure in which there is
a primary or core set of central species with feedbacks
from the radiating species has been demonstrated to
be a structure that amplifies evolutionary dynamics
(31). If such feedbacks do not exist, and these subnetworks of the lichen and tree genotypes are likely
to be multi-rooted networks. Such a structure is theorized to generally promote diversification as variation
arising from the shifting distribution of the “roots”,
i.e. genotypes; however, loss of genotype/root diversity could lead to fixation of a single genotype in
the population and a decrease in community-wide
diversity.

was conducted with a community of lichens, these results can be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms around the world that also exhibit significant
genetic signals at the community level (7, 56). However, there are important points to consider when
extending the observed genetically based response
of the lichen networks to other systems. As bark
lichen individuals do not move, but grow in a primarily two dimensional plane, these communities
and their interactions occur in the highly localized
context of the tree’s bark surface. Lichen individuals are also many orders of magnitude smaller than
the tree individual in this system (38). For these
reasons, the genetic effects on these communities is
not dampened by the movement of individuals and
the mixing of the effect of different tree genotypes
on the lichen community, as might occur for more
mobile species (e.g. insects and birds). Relatedly, we Conclusion. In the face of the high degree of comonly examined lichen in this study, and other species plexity and potential context dependency of ecologiwhose distributions, abundances and/or interactions cal processes, the current study points to the utility

other unmeasured tree traits or organisms correlated
with bark roughness are underlying the observed patterns, substantial research supports the importance
of genetically based tree traits for communities and
ecosystems (8), and in particular bark roughness for
bark lichen communities (38, 39, 49).
Another important point to consider is that in
the present study lichen cover, species richness and
composition were not significanlty responsive to tree
genotype, unlike what has been previously observed
for lichen (39) and multiple taxa in this and other
systems (8). This is likely the result of differences
in sampling method and the choice of genotypes
leading to overall higher abundances of observed
lichens to assure the possibility of observing lichen
interactions. In the current study mean percent total
lichen cover among genotypes ranges from 60-93%
cover; whereas the range reported in (39) is 0.8618.73%. The previous study used a visual estimation
method, unlike the current study, which observed
lichen at the scale of 1 cm2 cells, which could overestimate cover depending on the freqeuency at which
actual thallus size was less than 1 cm2 . The previous
study used samples from both the northern and
southern aspects of each tree; whereas, the current
study only observed lichen on the northern aspect.
Also, our current results are likely different from the
previous study because the current study selected
genotypes that tended to have bark lichen, with
the interest of focusing on generating networks for
comparison. These differences do not negate the
findings of either study but is important to explain
the differences in the findings, particularly in the
community-level effects of tree genotype and the
general applicability to future studies.

nity that include species with similar differences in
body-size and time-scales. As heritable variation is
the raw material for natural selection to act upon,
a genetic basis for interaction network structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered
at the community level and that conserving genetic
variation is important to consider in efforts to restore
or preserve complex species interactions and their
associated ecosystem functions (59). With such findings, it appears that we are closer to understanding
the evolutionary drivers of Darwin’s entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex
communities.
