Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure we conducted quantitative modeling of interaction
networks. We constructed networks of epiphytic lichen associated with
individual trees that were a part of a long-term experimental common
garden of genotypes of (\textit{Populus angustifolia}), a foundation
species. We found three main results. First, tree genotype
significantly predicted lichen network similarity, i.e. trees of the
same genotype had more similar lichen networks. Second, bark roughness
and condensed tannin concentration were both predicted by tree
genotype and correlated with lichen network similarity. Third, the
network metrics, the number of links and centrality, were both
correlated with several tree traits, including bark roughness and
condensed tannin concentration. We conclude that tree genotype
influences lichen interaction network structure with two potential
pathways through bark roughness and condensed tannin
concentration. These results provide evidence that variation in
ecological networks can result from genetically based variation in
foundation species.

%% Introduction

%% - Evolution occurs in complex ecological networks, which have been
%% treated primarily from a pairwise perspective
%% - Network ecology suggests that network architecture has important
%% implications for ecological and evolutionary dynamics
%% - Community genetics has shown that intraspecific variation impacts
%% communities and ecosystems
%% - What we know about networks in a community genetics context is
%% Bailey 2009 (tri-trophic chain), Bridgeland ????, Smith 2012
%% (geographic mosaic), Lamit 2015 (JoE), Lau 2016 (bipartite), Keith
%% 2017 (bipartite).
%% - None of these studies have looked at networks of organisms at a
%% scale in which population genetics of trees might impact entire
%% networks of interacting organisms, hence this study
%% - Hypothesis: based on the genetic similarity rule, genetically

%% similar interaction networks

\begin{itemize}
\item Evolution occurs in complex ecosystems
\item Community genetics studies have demonstrated the importance of
genetics and evolutionary dynamics in structuring communities and
ecosystems
\item Community composition, ecosystem processes have been shown to vary
in response to the genetic variation of foundation species
\item Previous studies have examined aspects of networks but to date, no
studies have examined the genetic basis of networks of interacting
species
\item Here we examine the genetic basis of network structure on a
community of sessile lignicolous (i.e. bark) lichen on cottonwood
trees. This system is ideal for examining for this kind of study
because it:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Lichen do not move among trees, although asexual propagules could
  move to other trees in the garden 
\item Is not unapproachably complex
\item Is comprised of distinct individuals that are small enough for an
  entire community to occur on a single tree but not too small to be
  quantified easily
\end{enumerate}

\item We hypothesize that trees will vary in some phenotypic traits, such
that trees of the same genotype will tend to have similar traits
producing similarities in lichen network structure. To test this
hypothesis, we use a common garden of cottonwood trees with lichen
communities.
\end{itemize}


\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex ecological
networks. Initially, evolution in a community context was focused on
examples of highly co-evolved pairs of species (e.g. Darwin's famous
prediction of the Sphinx Moth and Christmas Orchid)
cite{Wade2007}. However, studies of diffuse co-evolution
(\textit{sensu} cite{Janzen1980}) cite{Stinchcombe2002, Strauss2007,
  Dicke2010}, geographic mosaics of co-evolution cite{Thompson2005}
and community genetics cite{Whitham2006} have provided an in-road for
ecological network approaches cite{Fortuna2009, Keith2017, Lau2016}
to illuminate a more complex perspective of the interface between
ecological and evolutionary dynamics. There is now evidence to suport
that selection tends to occur among groups of species cite{Wade2007,
  Pieterse2007, Dicke2010} favoring the development of small webs
cite{Nuismer2006, Guimaraes2007, Gomez2009} and that genetic
variation and phylogenetic relatedness contributes to variation in
community assembly \cite{Crutsinger2016} and species interactions
cite{Whitham2006a, Bailey2009, Moya-Larano2011}, which shapes the
ecological interaction networks \cite{Rezende2007}.

\textbf{LJL: I think a key point in the first paragraph is to point
  out that networks are believe in part to emerge out of complex
  evolutionary interactions. But, to-date, the patterns observed in
  networks are primarily only on the scale of species interactions and
  phylogenetic signature. There has yet to be much work connecting
  ecological species networks at the scale relevant to the actual
  workings of microevolutionary processes (e.g., the genotype or
  population level).}

\textbf{LJL: likewise, studies of networks do not have a genetic
  component}

Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit2015a} have shown that
genetic variation in foundation species \cite{Ellison2005} plays a
significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting
organisms:  such as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and
soil microbes. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that genetic
variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical,
phenological, morphological) produces a multivariate phenotype
\cite{holeski2012} that contributes to variation in associated
communities \cite{Bailey2009a}.

\textbf{LJL: I think the thing that needs to emerge in this paragraph
  is that even though there is some incling that genotype is relevant
  in community networks, as based on our few past studies, no study
  has truely examined networks on individual trees.}


Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species, it also impacts the structure of the network of
species interactions in these communities \cite{Keith2017,
  Lau2015a}. Also, work by \citep{Toju2017, Toju2016, Toju2014a}
observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species
modules focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and likely
are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure and
dynamics.


More on the importance of ecological networks \cite{Guimaraes2011,
  Thompson2013a}.

Add a discussion of DesRoches.

From Thompson2014

\begin{itemize}
\item Pairwise interactions are usually influenced by other species
\item Selection favors the development of small webs
\item Evolution of new lifestyles leads to changes in slection on
  large and small webs
\end{itemize}

Specific hypothesis from Thompson2014

Selection in small webs


\textbf{LJL: If I recall, the Elamo paper just looks at genetic
  correlations between pairwise individual abundances. I would suggest
  maybe it doesn’t deserve to be in this 1st paragraph. Perhaps it
  actually should be in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph, just as a reference
  that points to the potential for genotype to influence
  networks. Definately our 2015 JOE paper goes much further, too,
  since it has whole communities being correlationed. But, again, I
  woudl put both of these as citation in the community genetics
  paragraphs (2 of 3) instead of the first paragrpah, which focuses on
  the general network lit.}


Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichen species. Using a long-term (20+
years), common garden experiment with replicated individuals of known
genetic identity and a naturally established stand of \textit{Populus
  angustifolia}. We focused on a model community of 9 epiphytic lichen
species, as previous research has demonstrated significant
compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic variation
\cite{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition, the life-history
characteristics of lichens, having highly localized, direct contact
interactions and slow population turnover rates, allowed us to assess
interactions among lichen species on individual trees. We hypothesize
that in natural systems evolution occurs in a community context
involving interactions of complex networks of interacting species
\cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017, Thompson2013, Bascompte2006}.  If correct,
we should expect to find that network structure is genetically based
in which different plant genotypes support different interaction
networks and that these interactions networks can function as
indicators of ecological dynamics important for conserving
biodiversity.  Applying a probability-theory based network modeling
approach, we constructed a set of interaction network models for the
lichens associated with individual trees. Using these models, we then
examined the genetic basis of the structure of these ecological
networks.


\textbf{LJL: I agree that there is a general overarching theme that
  evolution occurs in a community network context, but I’m not sure
  that we should state that as our main hypothesis. It seems more that
  this is a fundamental foundation for our work. The hypothesis is
  more what we are testing directly, but we don’t test this
  directly. I guess I don’t want to give the impresison that our
  communities are necessarily the result of each species evolving into
  its place in the community on these tree genotypes (although I do
  understand this as Shuster et al 2006’s fundamental explanation for
  why we see different communities on different genotypes; I don’t
  necessarily agree that this is the only reason we woudl see
  different communities on dif genotypes). Most of these are pretty
  generalist lichens, which could be found on other decidous trees in
  the surounding city or natural areas. I would look at it more like
  an assembling of lichen species into unique configurations on
  genetically different substrates. There may be some selection for
  different genotype of lichen during the community assembly process
  but we can’t really tell that just by differences in species
  abundances or coocurneces. I guess to me the evolutionary context
  that is more direclty related to this work is that the tree genotype
  is a central controller (indeed a sort of hub species in the
  network) of network structure. By anchoring the lichen network to
  tree genotype (and variation among networks to variation among tree
  genotypes) , our study highlights the possibility that natural
  selection acting on the trees may have an extended consequence for
  the network structure of organisms living on the trees…the extra
  thing we add to the field is that we show interaction networks are
  sensitive to genotype. I doubt the lichens have a direct effect on
  tree fitness, but favorability of some tree genotypes over others
  during natural selection will then go on to favor and disfavor
  certain lichen communities of different network structures. By being
  sensitive to tree genotype, the lichen community networks are
  passive riders on the waves of evolutionary dynamics that occur
  within the tree species they inhabit.}

\textbf{MKL: In response to Lamit's comment above, I agree that it is
  not reuqired that there is co-evolution. Another, perhaps simpler,
  explanation is that there is variation in environmental filtering of
  lichen individuals created in part by genetic variation in tree
  individuals.}



\matmethods{


\textbf{MKL: Need to add more citations of Lamits or other lichen
  studies.}

\textbf{LJL: If you include the field data, I would suggest changing
  the topic sentence for this paragraph and adding something about the
  field data sampling to this paragrpah. Note, also that we cored and
  aged each field tree so we can site the age range of the trees here,
  to make it clear they are within those of the garden.}


The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled. Bark lichens have been
extensively studied in this system and provide an ideal system in
which to observe and model lichen interaction networks, as their
sessile nature permits accurate identification of individuals
\cite{Lamit2011}.

A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect
of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment
associated with each individual and spatial
autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted in fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature
Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established individuals in
the common garden, we chose a total of thirteen genotypes, replicated
between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen Observations}

\textbf{LJL: A total pain in the butt but it might be good just to
  double check that our exact species that occured in each quadrat are
  the same as the species that I found in the composition data. No
  doubt that I woudl have foudn more species but it might be a good
  double check of things just to see if they roughly correspond. I can
  do this if you send me your matrix.}

\textbf{LJL: I think this sentence is good and these lichens tend to
  be ones that were rarer or really easy to miss. So, the list of
  species you picked up sounds logit to me. One thing… above you say
  14 species but only 9 were found. That is a bit redundant with this
  next sentence that highlights which species were found and which
  were not obsered. I would just stick with the second sentence and
  delete the first sentence.}


On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichens, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 10 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and 85
cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A and
B). The observed lichen community included (abbreviations are given
for species present in study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza
  galericulata}, Xm = \textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca
  holocarpa}, Cs = \textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg =
\textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh = \textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Pm =
\textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa = \textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu =
\textit{Physcia undulata}. Several other species were not obesrved in
the present study but are known to occur in this region:
\textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis}, \textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata},
\textit{Melanelia subolivacea}, \textit{Meanelia elegantula}.


The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (1 S.E.) (see Supporting Information). Based
on the median thallus size, we expected thalli observed in each cell
to generally be spatially independent of thalli present in other cells
but exposed to similar micro-environmental conditions created by the
bark and the location of the sampling area on an individual
tree. Therefore, we were confident in treating the cell-wise
observations in quadrats as independent with respect to lichen-lichen
interactions.

\textbf{LJL: My method was overal visual \% cover. I didn’t count P/A
  of rough bark in each square. So, yo might just want to site our
  Ecology lichen paper as showing rough bark is important, but not
  cite it as the same method. No doubt the methods should yeild
  similar results but the approach is slightly different.}


We also measured several bark traits for each tree: including, bark
roughness and chemistry. 

To quantify bark roughness, the number of cells containing disrupted,
fissured bark were counted within each quadrat. The number of rough
bark containing cells were then summed and divided by the total number
of cells surveyed. This was done for all quadrats on all trees in
which lichen communities were also observed. We also measured several
bark chemistry traits: including, pH, condensed tannins, carbon and
nitrogen. 

\textbf{MKL: will need Lamit to add the chemistry methods.}

\textbf{MKL: Remove A, then move current B up and C below. You can
  then present current D-K vertically and potentially increase their
  size.}

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

\textbf{LJL: This seems like a key point, one that really makes the
  study above and beyond.  I would make it clear with the phrasing
  that individual networks were created for each individual tree
  sampled, in this way we had replicated networks for each tree
  genotypes.}

We used the observations of lichens in the 1 cm$^2$ cells on individual
trees of \textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated
using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another
species $P(S_i | S_j)$, based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
$P(S_i)$ and the joint probability of co-occurrences $P(S_i,S_j)$
using the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We
were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each
species pair as $P(S_i|S_j) = \frac{P(S_i,S_j)}{P(S_j)}$, based on the
axioms of probability. This yielded a matrix that could possibly be
asymetric, i.e. $P(S_i|S_j)$ does not have to be equal to
$P(S_j|S_i)$. Another important property of this matrix is that the
diagonal ($S_{ii}$) was equal to one for all species present and zero
for species that were not observed in any cell.

\textbf{MKL: regarding Lamit's question about the symmetry, the point
  is that direction of the interaction matters. The effect of species
  A on B can be different from B on A. No the matrix is not
  necessarily triangular (triangular being that the matrix either
  above or below the diagonal is completely zero).}

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant
links between species. This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_i,S_j)$) is different from
zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}).  Here, a confidence interval
$CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j] * Z_{95\%} *
\sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E($S_iS_j$) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$) times the
independent probabilities of each species $P(S_i) * P(S_j)$,
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells times
the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_i,S_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_i,S_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability $P(S_i,S_j)$ is determined to be equal
to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i) \dot
P(S_j)$), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species $P(S_i)$. Therefore, unless the
co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence interval,
the probability that the observation of one species given the other is
no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting
conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities
from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional
probability is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero. The
resulting matrix ($\mathbf{D} = D_{ij}$) can be interpreted as how one
species impacts another with zero being no effect and values less than
or greater than zero interpreted as negative and positive effects,
respectively. Here, we will refer to this matrix ($\mathbf{D}$) as an
interaction matrix with the properties that it can be asymetric
(i.e. $P_{ij}$ does not necessarily equal $P_{ji}$), and the diagonal
($P_{ii}$) is zero (i.e. a species does not influence it's own
probability of being observed).

\textbf{LJL: This approach seems legit and it sound
  impressive. However, I admit that I think it is a bit above my head
  and possibly Tom’s, too. I have no doubt you did everything
  correct. But, it might be wise to get a friendly review from a mathy
  person just to be on the safe side. Perhaps Stuart in NC, or Aaron
  Ellison.} 

\textbf{MKL: agreed. This seems like a job for Bowker or Stuart. They
  can take a look on the next round of reviews.}

  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,

\textbf{LJL: I like the details here. THe one thing is that it sort of
  makes the reader think there is only one quadrat on a tree but
  infact there were two. I think you want to make sure to be explicit
  about the two. For analytical purposes, was all the data lumped so
  there was really functionally a 20cm by 10cm grid (just split into
  two pieces). Or, was the network made for each of the two grids and
  them averaged or combined in some way? My understanding is that it
  was more the first than the latter.}

\textbf{MKL: Yeah, it was the latter. I'm using two quadrats lumped
  together. I'll add more text here to clarify that.}


\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of
genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction
networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we
used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML). We used a combination of Least Squares Regression,
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark roughness,
lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet
the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality for these
tests.

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community
composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate
statistical approaches, including Permutational Analysis of Variance
(PERMANOVA) and Mantel tests. For some analyses, community composition
was relativized by species maxima to reduce the effect of the highly
abundant \textit{X. galericulata}. For community composition we used
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, which has optimal performance with count
data citep{Minchen1998}. To quantify the similarity of lichen
networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise Euclidean
distance of the $\mathbf{D}$ interaction matrices among all pairs of
trees.

For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) cite{ecodist} to produce
dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multi-variate responses and
fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values cite{vegan}. Using random initial configurations with a
maximum of 500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less
than 10$^{-12}$. Final configurations has the lowest stress with at
most a stress level of 0.10.


For each network, we also calculated metrics that measure different
structural aspects. Although there are many other metrics, for the
sake of simplicity we focus on a subset that represent several
interesting features of network structure (see \citep{Lau2017a}). We
calculated the number of interactions or ``links'' in each network,
which provides a measure of the size of the network citep{Lau2015,
  Borrett2014}. We also calculated the centralization of each network,
which measures the evenness of the distribution of interactions among
the species in the network cite{Butts2005}. In a network with a low
level of centralization species have similar amount of interaction in
the network, while a network with a high level of centralization tends
to have one or small number of species that interact with other
species. We used a related function to calculate the centrality of
each species (i.e. node level centrality) in each network as well. The
modularity of each network was also quantified using a weighted
algorithm cite{Beckett2016}, which measures the degree to which a
given network is divided into groups of species more connected to each
other than other species. As with the other response variables, the
number of links was log-transformed and both modularity and
centralization scores were fourth-root transformed to meet variance
and normality assumptions.

All code and data for the project are openly available online. Code
and data are available at \url{github.com/ecgen/comgen}. The project
is also archived via Zenodo at \url{zenodo.com/doiXXXXXX}. All
analyses were conducted using the programming language R version 3.6.1
(R Development Core Team 2019).

\section*{Results}

Network similarity and several tree traits were genetically
based. Tree genotype was a significant predictor of network similarity
(H$^2$ = 0.16, \textit{p-value} $\leq$ 0.001). Bark roughness (H$^2$ =
0.38, \textit{p-value} $\leq$ 0.001) and condensed tannin
concentration (H$^2$ = 0.28, \textit{p-value} = 0.014) also showed a
signature of tree genotype (Fig.~\ref{fig:h2_plot}); however, this was
not the case for other tree traits, bark pH and carbon to nitrogen
ratio. Also, none of the lichen network metrics were significantly
predicted by tree genotype, either at the scale of the entire network
(Table~\ref{tab:h2_table}) or for individual species (see Supporting
Information). Although both showed a response to tree genotype, bark
roughness and condensed tannins were not correlated (Pearson's $r$ =
0.084, \textit{p-value} = 0.556).

\end{figure*}

Tree traits and lichen community metrics were correlated with lichen
networks. The genetically based traits, bark roughness and condensed
tannins were both significant predictors of network similarity
(Table~\ref{tab:cn_perm}). Bark C:N ratio was also a significant
predictor of network similarity, but, as shown previously (see
Table~\ref{tab:h2_table}), there is not sufficient evidence support a
genetic basis for it. Bark pH was not a significant predictor of
lichen network similarity (Table~\ref{tab:cn_perm}). The abundance,
richness, evenness and diversity of the bark lichen community,
although also not predicted by tree genotype, were all significantly
correlated with lichen network structure
(Table~\ref{tab:cn_perm}). Lichen community composition was not
correlated with lichen network similarity, either when species
abundances were relativized (Mantel R = -0.09, \textit{p-value} =
0.139) or not (Mantel R = -0.03, \textit{p-value} = 0.573).

\section*{Discussion}

%%% Discussion points

- Genotypic variation can lead to network variation
- Traits could both share or be a causal mechanism with lichen networks.
- Network structure is linked to function and dynamics. E.g. stability

- Community level selection may be possible, but this is not a
necessary factor for evolutionary dynamics to be relevant to ecological networks

- What are the conditions in which genetically based ecological
network structure could have an effect?

- Network structure serves to amplify the signal of genetics


\textbf{TGW: I think window is too vague and this topic sentence needs
  to be much stronger for a journal like PNAS.  Might be stronger by
  saying "Our findings argue there is a genetic component to network
  structure, which implies that network structure could be subject to
  selection and networks can evolve."}

\textbf{TGW: Could we also make the comparsion that genetically more
  similar trees also have more similar communities?  We've done this
  in the past and it has worked, e.g., Randy's genetic similarity
  rule.}

\begin{itemize}
\item Genetic assembly rule = similar genetics will have more similar
  communities
\item What we don't know is whether or not these interactions will
  also lead to similar interactions among other species.
\item Thus, it would be possible for genetics to not only influence
  other species directly, but also indirectly by influencing the
  interactions among other species.
\end{itemize}

We observed significant lichen interaction structure that varied among
genotypes of a foundation tree species, narrowleaf cottonwood
(\textit{P. angustifolia}). We found that a genetically based trait,
bark roughness, partially explained the variation in lichen
interaction networks. Some of this variation in lichen networks was
related to both the overall abundance and species richness of lichen;
though, statistically controlling for the effect of genotype on these
variables indicates that a significant portion of the variance in
lichen species richness is due to a factor other than tree
genotype. By using network metrics, we were also able to probe for
specific characteristics of how these networks were responding to tree
genotype. We found that both number of links and the centralization of
the networks were highly correlated with network similarity and that
tree genotype significantly predicted network centrality but only
marginally predicted the number of network links. This latter result
could be due to the relationship between species richness and the
number of links in the network, which were significanlty correlated
with each other. We also found that bark roughness did not
significantly predict either the number of links or the centrality of
lichen networks, suggesting that bark roughness has some other effect
on the structure of the lichen networks. Taken together, these
findings support the hypothesis that genotypic variation in a
foundation species contributes to the structure of a network of
interacting species.

\textbf{LJL: I wonder if you need to have so much on richness here. 
Overall, I think you want to focus on the network reponses and
patterns among genotype first, and then go into mechanism later. I
think we don’t quite have a good mechanism yet so I don’t think it
needs to come up in the first paragrpah of the discussion.}



These findings point to the importance of understanding the community
level effects of genetic variation in plant functional traits and
highlights the potential for indirect effects of genetic variation to
propagate through networks of interacting species and trophic levels.

This work corroborates previous findings of the importance of plant
genetics in shaping community structure and ecosystem
processes. citep{Bangert2008}


Altering the structure of interaction networks presents a means for
genetic effects to be magnified within the system of interacting
species. For example, \citep{Keith2017} showed that the genetics based
interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible trees resulted
in different interaction networks of their associated arthropod
communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of ecosystems,
trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates of energy
and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype.

\textbf{LJL:  It could be useful to point out that our findings are
  not related to trophic interactions, which is pretty cool. Also,we
  talk about interaction networks but it is not clear to me if the
  interactions tend to be positive or negative. Can we get at that
  with the approach used?}


\textbf{TGW:  Is there any adaptive component to the tree in having
  certain lichen communities?  e.g., can they feed back to affect tree
  performance in some way or is this a passive outcome of a trait that
  affects bark for other adaptive reasons and lichens are passive
  players that tag along for the ride?  I could envision that lichens
  covering the bark of a tree act as a barrier between insects and
  pathogens, much like ectomycorrhizae cover fine roots as a first
  line of defense by invading microorganisms.  Uptake of N that gets
  passed to the tree??}


\textbf{TGW: might be good to cite papers on competition in lichens or
  other organizing factors to back up the least expected statement.
  as epiphytes we might not expect them to care.}

\textbf{TGW: I think we need to emphasize the long-term nature of our
  common garden study as very few common garden studies of lichens
  likely exist. Any refs on this? If true might want to mention this
  up front in intro.}

\textbf{MKL: Environmental filtering is evidenced by species richness,
  but also possibly species interaction varying based on environment
  as networks varied in terms of sign and magnitude as well.}

\textbf{MKL: The effect of bark roughness on network similarity was
  primarily genetically based, and there are likely other factors at
  play.}

\textbf{Discussion of network implications for stability with genetics.}

Bark roughness had previously been shown to be an important tree trait
influencing bark lichens \cite{Lamit2011} that is under strong genetic
control \cite{Bdeir2017}.

Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}. In the face of the
high degree of complexity and potential context dependency of
ecological processes, the current study points to the utility of
considering the spatial and temporal scales of interactions, as
discussed to some in previous studies \cite{Bangert2006, Zook2010,
  Zytynska2012}. In the present study, we found that community
assembly processes, such as environmental filtering and species
interactions, are genetically based. This is likely due, in part, to
the large difference in the differences in size and longevity of the
lichen and cottonwood individuals with the trees determining the
environment in which the lichen occur. We suggest that future work
would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with similar differences in body-size
and time-scales. As heritable variation is the raw material for
natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer
to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex communities.
