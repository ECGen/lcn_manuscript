Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure we conducted quantitative modeling of interaction
networks. We constructed networks of epiphytic lichens associated with
individual trees that were a part of a long-term experimental common
garden of genotypes of (\textit{Populus angustifolia}), a foundation
species. We found two primary results. First, tree genotype
significantly predicted lichen network similarity, i.e. clonal
replicates of the same genotype tended to support more similar lichen
networks, using multiple network metrics. Second, one of the examined
tree traits, bark roughness, was both predicted by tree genotype and
correlated with lichen network similarity, supporting a mechanistic
pathway from a variration in a heritable tree trait and the
genetically based variation in lichen network structure. We conclude
that tree genotype can influence not only the relative abundances of
organisms but also the interaction network structure of associated
organisms. Given that variation in network structure can have
consequences for the dynamics of communities through altering the
stability of the system and modulating or amplifying perturbations,
these results have important implications for the evolutionary
dynamics of ecosystems.

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex ecological
networks. Initially, evolution in a community context was focused on
examples of highly co-evolved pairs of species (e.g. Darwin's famous
prediction of the Sphinx Moth and Christmas Orchid)
\cite{Wade2007TheCommunities}. However, studies of diffuse
co-evolution (\textit{sensu} \cite{Janzen1980SpecificityForest})
\cite{StinchcombeCanHerbivores, Strauss2008EvolutionSize}, geographic
mosaics of co-evolution \cite{Thompson2013} and community genetics
\cite{Whitham2006a} have provided an in-road for ecological network
approaches \cite{Smith2015b, Keith2017, Lau2016GenotypicEvolution} to
illuminate a more complex perspective of the interface between
ecological and evolutionary dynamics. There is now evidence to support
that selection tends to occur among groups of species
\cite{Wade2007TheCommunities} favoring the development of small webs
\cite{Guimaraes2007InteractionNetworks, Gomez2009LocalMosaic} and that
genetic variation and phylogenetic relatedness contributes to
variation in community assembly \cite{Crutsinger2016} and species
interactions \cite{Whitham2006a, Bailey2009a, Moya-Larano2011}, which
shapes the ecological interaction networks \cite{Rezende2007}.

Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit2015a} have shown that genetic
variation in foundation species \cite{Ellison2005} plays a significant
role in defining distinct communities of interacting organisms:  such
as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and soil
microbes. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that genetic
variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical,
phenological, morphological) produces a multivariate phenotype
\cite{holeski2012} that contributes to variation in associated
communities \cite{Bailey2009a}. The importance of genetic variation in
structuring ecological systems was recently reviewed
\cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}, and not only were many instances of
strong genetic effects found in many ecosystems but the effect of
intraspecific variation was at times greater than
\textit{inter}-specific variation.

Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species but that it also impacts the structure of species
interactions. However, studies in the network ecology literature
generally do not include a genetic component
\cite{Borrett2014EnaR:Analysis}; and, community genetics studies have
primarily focused on community composition in terms of the abundance
of species \cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}. Multiple studies from
different plant-associated communities (including \textit{Populus},
\textit{Solidago}, \textit{Oenothera}, \textit{Salix}) have examined
the effect of genetic variation on trohic interactions
\cite{Bailey2005ImportanceInteractions, Johnson2008, Smith2011, Smith2015b,
  Barbour2016GeneticComplexity} and generally found that increasing
genotypic diversity leads to increased trophic complexity. Similarly,
two other studies have examined the effect of genotypic variation on
the structure of interactions between tree individuals and the
associated community \cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017} and both found that
genotypic diversity generates increased network modularity
(i.e. compartmentalization).


\parshape=0

Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichen species. Previous studies have
examined aspects of networks \citep{Barbour2019TraitCommunities}. Here
we examine the genetic basis of network structure on a community of
sessile lignicolous (i.e. bark) lichens on cottonwood trees. Using a
long-term (20+ years), common garden experiment with replicated
individuals of known genetic identity and a naturally established
stand of \textit{Populus angustifolia}. We focused on a model
community of 9 epiphytic lichen species, as previous research has
demonstrated significant compositional responses of epiphytes to
genotypic variation \citep{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition,
the life-history characteristics of lichens, having highly localized,
direct contact interactions and slow population turnover rates,
facilitated the assessment of interactions among lichen species on
individual trees. We hypothesize that in natural systems evolution
occurs in a community context involving interactions of complex
networks of interacting species \cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017,
  Thompson2013, Bascompte2006}.  If correct, we expect to find that
network structure is genetically based in which different plant
genotypes support different interaction networks and that these
interactions networks can function as indicators of ecological
dynamics important for conserving biodiversity.  Applying a
probability-theory based network modeling approach, we constructed a
set of interaction network models for the lichens associated with
individual trees. Using these models, we then examined the genetic
basis of the structure of these ecological networks. Based on previous
community genetics studies, particularly \citep{Bangert2006} which
proposed the community similarity rule, we hypothesize that trees will
vary in some phenotypic traits and those trees of the same genotype
will tend to have similar traits leading to similarities in lichen
network structure.

\subsection*{Study System}

The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled. Bark lichens have been
extensively studied in this system and provide an ideal system in
which to observe and model lichen interaction networks, as their
sessile nature permits accurate identification of individuals
\cite{Lamit2011}.

A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect
of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment
associated with each individual and spatial
autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted in fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature
Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established individuals in
the common garden, we chose a total of ten genotypes, replicated
between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen and Trait Observations}


On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichens, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 100 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and 95
cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A and
B). The observed lichen community included (abbreviations are given
for species present in study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza
  galericulata}, Xm = \textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca
  holocarpa}, Cs = \textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg =
\textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh = \textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Pm =
\textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa = \textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu =
\textit{Physcia undulata}. Several other species were not obesrved in
the present study but are known to occur in this region:
\textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis}, \textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata},
\textit{Melanelia subolivacea}, \textit{Meanelia elegantula}.


The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (1 S.E.) (see Supporting Information). Based
on the median thallus size, we expected thalli observed in each cell
to generally be spatially independent of thalli present in other cells
but exposed to similar micro-environmental conditions created by the
bark and the location of the sampling area on an individual
tree. Therefore, we were confident in treating the cell-wise
observations in quadrats as independent with respect to lichen-lichen
interactions.



We also measured several bark traits for each tree: including, bark
roughness, condensed tannin, carbon and nitrogen concentrations and
pH. \textbf{ADD METHODS FROM JAMIE}.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

For each tree, repeated observations of lichen were made in order to
construct replicated interaction networks for each genotype. We
conducted a modified sampling procedure originally developed by
\citep{Lamit2015a} with the addition that we quantified the presence of
lichen in the 1 cm$^2$ cells on individual trees of
\textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated using the
conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the probability
of observing one species given an observation of another species
$P(S_i | S_j)$, based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
$P(S_i)$ and the joint probability of co-occurrences $P(S_i,S_j)$
using the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We
were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each
species pair as $P(S_i|S_j) = \frac{P(S_i,S_j)}{P(S_j)}$, based on the
axioms of probability. This yielded a matrix that could possibly be
asymetric, i.e. $P(S_i|S_j)$ does not have to be equal to
$P(S_j|S_i)$. Another important property of this matrix is that the
diagonal ($S_{ii}$) was equal to one for all species present and zero
for species that were not observed in any cell.

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant
links between species. This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_i,S_j)$) is different from
zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}).  Here, a confidence interval
$CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j] * Z_{95\%} *
\sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E($S_iS_j$) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$) times the
independent probabilities of each species $P(S_i) * P(S_j)$,
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells times
the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_i,S_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_i,S_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability $P(S_i,S_j)$ is determined to be equal
to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i) \dot
P(S_j)$), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species $P(S_i)$. Therefore, unless the
co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence interval,
the probability that the observation of one species given the other is
no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting
conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities
from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional
probability is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero. The
resulting matrix ($\mathbf{D} = D_{ij}$) can be interpreted as how one
species impacts another with zero being no effect and values less than
or greater than zero interpreted as negative and positive effects,
respectively. Here, we will refer to this matrix ($\mathbf{D}$) as an
interaction matrix with the properties that it can be asymetric
(i.e. $P_{ij}$ does not necessarily equal $P_{ji}$), and the diagonal
($P_{ii}$) is zero (i.e. a species does not influence it's own
probability of being observed). 

\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lcn_araujo_method.pdf}
\caption{Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting
  field observations in 1 cm$^2$ cells within a 100 cm$^2$ grid on each
  tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of $N$
  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,
  $P(S_i|S_j)$, for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to
  zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, $P(S_i S_j)$, were
  not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of
  their observed co-occurrence frequency, $S_iS_j$, to that expected
  due to chance alone, $E[P(S_iS_j)] = P(S_i) P(S_j)$, and
  $P(S_i|S_j)$ reduces to $P(S_i)$, the observed individual
  probability of species $S_i$. In the context of these networks,
  asymetry and positive/negative valued connections are distinct
  quantities. In-coming and out-going connections can be interpreted
  as ``influenced by'' and ``influenced'', respectively; while
  positive and negative should be seen as one species increasing or
  decreasing, respectively, the probability of another species'
  occurrence.}
\label{fig:conet_method}
\end{figure*}


\subsection*{Network Metrics}

To quantify the structural variation of lichen networks we calculated
several metrics at both the node and whole-network level. For
individual nodes (i.e. species) in each network, we calculated both
the degree \eqref{eq:1} and the centrality. We also calculated two
similar global network metrics: degree and centralization. The first
was network degree, which is a count of the total number of links in a
network. As the networks contained not only positive and negative
connections, as well as directional connections (both in-coming and
out-going), we calculated the same network metrics for all
combinations of these types of connections in each network. Although
there are many more possible network metrics that could have been
examined, we chose to focus on a restricted set for the sake of
clarity. Also, degree and centrality form the basis of many other
network metrics. 

\textbf{ADD EQUATIONS FOR METRICS}

\begin{equation}
  \sum{x_i}\label{eq:1}
\end{equation}

\begin{itemize}
\item Node degree
\item Node centrality
\item Network degree
\item Centralization 
\item In vs out 
\item Pos vs neg 
\end{itemize}

To calculate separate metrics for positive and negative links, we
applied methods for calculating the centrality accounting for the
sign differences \cite{Everett2014NetworksTies}. We used the \texttt{signnet}
package version ????, which is available at ???.


\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of
genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction
networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we
used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML). We used a combination of Least Squares Regression,
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark roughness,
lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet
the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality for these
tests.

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community
composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate
statistical approaches, including Permutational Analysis of Variance
(PERMANOVA) and Mantel tests. To quantify the similarity of lichen
networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise Euclidean
distance of the $\mathbf{D}$ interaction matrices among all pairs of
trees.

For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) \cite{ecodist} to produce
dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multi-variate responses and
fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values \cite{vegan}. Using random initial configurations with a
maximum of 500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less
than 10$^{-12}$. Final configurations has the lowest stress with at
most a stress level of 0.10.

For each network, we also calculated metrics that measure different
structural aspects. Although there are many other metrics, for the
sake of simplicity we focus on a subset that represent several
interesting features of network structure (see \citep{Lau2017a}). We
calculated the number of interactions or ``links'' in each network,
which provides a measure of the size of the network \citep{Lau2015a,
  Borrett2014EnaR:Analysis}. We also calculated the centralization of
each network, which measures the evenness of the distribution of
interactions among the species in the network \cite{sna}. In a network
with a low level of centralization species have similar amount of
interaction in the network, while a network with a high level of
centralization tends to have one or small number of species that
interact with other species. We used a related function to calculate
the centrality of each species (i.e. node level centrality) in each
network as well.

For all tests where genotype was used as a predictor, we quantified
the heritability of the response variable. Because the trees in the
garden were clonal replicates of each genotype, we calculated
broad-sense heritability, which is the genotypic variance divided by
the total phenotypic variance \cite{Conner2004ATextbook}. This can be
interpreted as a measure of the phenotypic variance due to genotypic
variation. We also apply this to the community genetics context as the
variance in \textit{extended} phenotypic variance due to genotypic
variation \cite{DawkinsTheGene}. For the
multivariate analyses, where we employ PERMANOVA, we followed the
methods of \citep{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE} to adjust the degrees of freedom for
unbalanced genotype replicates.

Tree genotype influenced lichen network structure.  Tree genotype
significantly predicted the structural similarity of lichen networks
(PERMANOVA: Pseudo-$F_{9,27}$ = 3.58, $H^2$ = 0.41, \textit{p-value} =
0.0537) (Fig.~\ref{fig:h2_plot}).  Overall network level metrics
responded signficantly to tree genotype (Table~\ref{tab:h2_net}),
including network degree (\textit{RLRT} = 3.52, $H^2$ = 0.32,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0255) and centralization including both in-coming
and out-going links (\textit{RLRT} = 4.04, $H^2$ = 0.33,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0184) or when separated into in-coming only
(\textit{RLRT} = 3.9852, $H^2$ = 0.3309, \textit{p-value} = 0.0190) or
out-going only (\textit{RLRT} = 3.8615, $H^2$ = 0.3193,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0205).  Metrics including only positive links
also showed a signficant effect of tree genotype, including positive
degree (\textit{RLRT} = 3.6925, $H^2$ = 0.3242, \textit{p-value} =
0.0229), positive in-going centralization (\textit{RLRT} = 4.4812,
$H^2$ = 0.3487, \textit{p-value} = 0.0142) Metrics calculated with
negative links were not significant, including degree (negative)
(\textit{RLRT} = 0.0327, $H^2$ = 0.0318, \textit{p-value} = 0.3859)
and both in-coming (negative) (\textit{RLRT} = 0.3304, $H^2$ = 0.1057,
\textit{p-value} = 0.2508) and out-going centralization (negative)
(\textit{RLRT} = 0.0862, $H^2$ = 0.0513, \textit{p-value} = 0.3446).

The genetic response of network centralization was driven by variation
in \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa}. Centrality varied significantly among
species ($F_{8, 324}$ = 7.99, $R^2$ = 0.16, \textit{p-value} $<$
0.0001). \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa} centrality was the main species
to exhibit a significant response to tree genotype in terms of
positive centrality for both the in-coming (\textit{RLRT} = 3.61,
$H^2$ = 0.32, \textit{p-value} = 0.0240) and out-going (\textit{RLRT}
= 3.13, $H^2$ = 0.30, \textit{p-value} = 0.0327) perspectives, but not
for either negative centrality metrics in-coming (\textit{RLRT} = 0,
$H^2$ = 0, \textit{p-value} = 1) or out-going (\textit{RLRT} = 0,
$H^2$ = 0, \textit{p-value} = 0.4543). None of the other species'
centralities showed a genotypic response (Supplementary
Table~\ref{tab:sppcen}) with the exception of \textit{X. montana}
(\textit{RLRT} = 2.92, $H^2$ = 0.32, \textit{p-value} = 0.0375);
however, the centrality of \textit{X. montana} was much lower overall
relative to \textit{C. holocarpa} and the variation in
\textit{X. montana} centrality was restricted to two genotypes
(Fig.~\ref{fig:geno_sppcen}).

    holocarpa} centrality was highly variable among
  genotypes. \textit{Xanthomendoza montana} centrality, both in- and
  out-degree, was only non-zero for two genotypes, and only out-degree
  centrality displayed a significant response to genotype.}
\label{fig:geno_sppcen}
\end{figure*}


Genotype indirectly influenced lichen network centralization via the
genetically based variation in bark roughness. The percent of rough
bark was the only tree trait that displayed a significant response to
genotype (\textit{RLRT} = 4.8526, $H^2$ = 0.3221, \textit{p-value} =
0.0113). None of the other bark traits, condensed tannins
(\textit{RLRT} = 0.0007, $H^2$ = 0.0041, \textit{p-value} = 0.4439),
pH (\textit{RLRT} = 0.00, $H^2$ = 0.00, \textit{p-value} = 1.0000) or
carbon-nitrogen Ratio (\textit{RLRT} = 0.0000, $H^2$ = 0.0000,
\textit{p-value} = 1.0000), showed a signficant response to tree
genotype and none other than bark roughness were correlated with
network similarity (Supplementary Table~\ref{tab:cn_trait_perm});
therefore, we focused our analysis on bark roughness. We found that
bark roughness was signficantly correlated with network similarity
(PERMANOVA:  Pseudo-$F_{1,32}$ = 13.029, $R^2$ = 0.26,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0096) and other lichen network metrics, including
negative correlations with overall network degree ($df$ = 35, $t$ =
-2.13, $r$ = -0.34, \textit{p-value} = 0.04) and centralization ($df$
= 35, $t$ = -2.52, $r$ = -0.39, \textit{p-value} = 0.02). To determine
how much of the effect of bark roughness was genetically based, we
used the residual values from regressions of network degree and
centralization in tests of the effect of tree genotype and found no
significant effect of tree genotype for either degree (\textit{RLRT} =
0.00, $H^2$ = 0.00, \textit{p-value} = 1.0000) or centralization
(\textit{RLRT} = 0.00, $H^2$ = 0.00, \textit{p-value} = 1.0000),
suggesting that the observed relationship between bark roughness and
lichen network structure was largely genetically based
(Fig.~\ref{fig:br_net}).

\section*{Discussion}


We found that tree genotype influenced lichen network structure in the
experimental cottonwood forest. Network similarity and metrics of
network structure tended to be more similar on trees of the same
genotype. Generally, this genetic effect was manifested in positive
interactions and largely driven by \textit{C. holocarpa}. The
genetically based trait, bark roughness, was the main driver of
network variation, largely via shifts in positive in-coming and
out-going interactions. Bark roughness has been demonstrated
previously to be under strong genetic control \cite{Bdeir2017}, and
bark roughness has also previously been shown to be an important tree
trait influencing bark lichens \cite{Lamit2015a}; however this is the
first demonstration of a link from genes to lichen network structure.
As such these results have important implications for the potential
influence of genetically based variation in ecosystems with networks
of interacting species.

There are important functional ramifications of genetically based
variation in network structure. First, even if the composition of the
communities is the same among individuals and genotypes, interactions
may not be. We didn't observe compositional differences using the same
data from which the lichen networks were derived. If we only had our
composition dataset from this study, we would have concluded no
response of the lichen community to tree genotype, even though the
underlying interactions among lichen species does vary among
genotypes. Community composition of lichen has previously been
observed to be different among tree genotype in the same experimental
garden, though this was observed with a larger sampling of total area
and quadrats per tree. Regardless, this could result in a situtation
in which abundance based investigations of community-level genetic
effects may miss important variation in the interactions among
individuals in these communities, leading to an underestimate of
genetic effects in ecosystems. It is possible that these underlying
differences in interactions among lichen could lead to differences in
community composition at a future point in time, however, this is not
needed for evolutionary dynamics to play out.

Second, following on the previous point, genetic diversity could be
influencing the stability of communities through the effects on the
structure of interactions. Some network structures are likely to be
more stable, either in response to disturbance or via self-organized
dynamics. For example, centralized networks, although more effecient,
are theorized to be more susceptible to targeted attacks on the center
of the network. For example, consider a forest with two genotypes that
support lichen communities that are similar in total abundances of
each species but differ in terms of the structure. Extensions of game
theory to evolutionary biology have demonstrated that network
structure can lead to variation in evolutionary dynamics. Some
structures tend toward dominance and dampening of selection, while
others lead to amplification of selection (Newman). One class of
networks that are theorized to have amplifying effects on networks
have "star" shapes with one or a few species at the center and
radiating interactions out from the central core (Leiberman). This is
structurally what we have observed with the networks that tend to
occur on some of the genotypes in our study, i.e. the more centralized
networks. It is possible that these more centralized networks could
function as hot-spots of evolutionary dynamics resulting from the
amplifying effect the network structure fostered on that tree
genotype.

Altering the structure of interaction networks presents a means for
genetic effects to be magnified within the system of interacting
species. For example, \citep{Keith2017} showed that the genetics based
interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible trees resulted
in different interaction networks of their associated arthropod
communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of ecosystems,
trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates of energy
and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype. Also, work by \citep{Toju2017, Toju2016, Toju2014a} observed
consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species modules
focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other words, a
small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and likely
are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure and
dynamics. 


There are several important points to consider with regard to the
generalization of the observed genetically based response of the
lichen networks. Body size and sessile nature of lichen important to
observing genotype responses. As bark lichen individuals do not move,
but grow in a largely two dimensional plane, these communities and
their interactions occur in the highly localized context of the tree's
bark surface. Lichen individuals are many orders of magnitude smaller
than the tree individual and the life-span of a tree is many times
that of a lichen. For these reasons, any genetic effects on these
communities is not dampened by the movement of individuals and the
mixing of the effect of different tree genotypes on the lichen
community, as might occur for more mobile species (e.g. insects and
birds). We only looked at lichen, other species whose distribution,
abundance or interactions respond to tree genotype, such as epiphytic
plants (e.g. moss and liverworts), algae or insects, could be playing
a role. Other traits could also be playing a role, such as traits that
are correlated with bark roughness, such as micro-aspect, albedo,
moisture, etc.



%% Interestingly, structure of interactions within a functional group
%% have typically been abstracted or ignored in ecological network
%% studies. A good example of this is the bipartite network literature,
%% which explicitely does not include interactions within groups in the
%% analysis of ecological networks, such as plant-pollinator
%% interactions. The basis for this is that interactions within groups do
%% not contribute substantively to the dynamics of the system. Here, we
%% clearly show a mechanistic basis for the structure of an associated
%% community of lichen. 


Bark roughness could possibly be serving the role that other lichen
play in facilitating the success of new propagule attachment and the
growth of establishing thalli. This is supported by the patterns
overall being positive, including \textit{C. holocarpa} centrality. We
did not observe specific micro-scopic dynamics, such as photobionts,
mycobionts, endolichenic fungi and bacteria, but variation in these
underlying interactions could also be playing a role. Although we can
not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured tree traits or
organisms correlated with bark roughness are underlying the observed
patterns in bark lichen network structure, substantial research
supports the importance of genetically based tree traits for
communities and ecosystems \cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}, and in
particular bark roughness for bark lichen communities \cite{Bdeir2017,
  Lamit2011, Lamit2015a},


Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}. In the face of the
high degree of complexity and potential context dependency of
ecological processes, the current study points to the utility of
considering the spatial and temporal scales of interactions, as
discussed to some in previous studies \cite{Bangert2006, Zook2010,
  Zytynska2012}. In the present study, we found that community
assembly processes, such as environmental filtering and species
interactions, are genetically based. This is likely due, in part, to
the large difference in the differences in size and longevity of the
lichen and cottonwood individuals with the trees determining the
environment in which the lichen occur. We suggest that future work
would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with similar differences in body-size
and time-scales. As heritable variation is the raw material for
natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer
to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex communities.


Future work should consider the potential influence on evolutionary
dynamics of the associated communities. The network of interactions of
species that are strongly influenced by a foundation species, could
amplify the effects of genotype, this serves as a means for genetic
effects to increase rather than diffuse through an ecosystem either
through space or over time, as has been proposed in the construction
of the genetic diffusion hypothesis. Altered abundances can lead to
differences in interactions Genotype effects on abundances of
individual abundances may cancel out. Specifically for asexually
reproducing species, such as many lichen are, shifting interaction
frequencies could lead to evolutionary outcomes, given the potential
to take-up symbionts and genetic material from thalli that they come
into contact with. Altering interaction frequencies could differences
in the frequencies the exchange of genetic materials among lichen that
could then be passed on to vegetative and possibly sexually produced
reproductive propagules. The larger scale (stand or region) effects of
these "evolutionary units" on each tree would depend on the
connectivity and rate of movement of propagules among trees per the
geographic mosaic of co-evolution hypothesis \cite{Barbour2009c,
  Thompson2013}.


\subsection*{Other studies that should be discussed:}

Trait plasticity is more important than genetic variation in
determining species richness of associated communities. Synthesis:
These results indicate that trait plasticity can be a dominant driver
of above- and below-ground biodiversity (Barbour 2018).

Multiple plant traits shape the genetic basis of herbivore community
assembly. Synthesis: Taken together, our results support that the
genetic basis of herbivore community assembly occurs through a suite
of plant traits for different herbivore species and feeding guilds
(Barbour 2015).

Contingency rules for pathogen competition and antagonism in a
genetically based, plant defense hierarchy. Synthesis: Our results
point to a Populus defense hierarchy with resistance genes on top,
followed by pathogen competition, and finally pathogen antagonism by
endophytes. We expect these rules will help to explain the variation
in pathogen antagonism that is currently attributed to context
dependency (Busby 2019).

Linking plant genes to insect communities:  Identifying the genetic
bases of plant traits and community composition. Synhesis: These
findings support the concept that particular plant traits are the
mechanistic link between plant genes and the composition of associated
insect communities (Barker 2019).

Genotypic variation in phenological plasticity:  Reciprocal common
gardens reveal adaptive responses to warmer springs but not to fall
frost. Synthesis: Trees transferred to warmer climates generally
showed small to moderate shifts in an adaptive direction, a hopeful
result for climate change. Trees experiencing cooler climates
exhibited large, non‐adaptive changes, suggesting smaller transfer
distances for assisted migration (Cooper 2018).

Epigenetic inheritance across the landscape. Synthesis:
Transgenerational epigenetic variation may alter the interpretation of
landscape genomic studies that rely upon phenotypic analyses, but
should have less influence on landscape genomic approaches that rely
upon outlier analyses or genome-environment associations (Whipple
2018).

%%   but we can’t really tell that just by differences in species

%%   that is more direclty related to this work is that the tree genotype
%%   is a central controller (indeed a sort of hub species in the

%%   selection acting on the trees may have an extended consequence for
%%   the network structure of organisms living on the trees…the extra
%%   thing we add to the field is that we show interaction networks are

%%   during natural selection will then go on to favor and disfavor
%%   certain lichen communities of different network structures. By being
%%   sensitive to tree genotype, the lichen community networks are
%%   passive riders on the waves of evolutionary dynamics that occur
%%   within the tree species they inhabit.}
