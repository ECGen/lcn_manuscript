Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure, we conducted quantitative modeling of interaction
network for a community of epiphytic lichens in a long-term
experimental common garden of genotyped trees of a foundation species
(\textit{Populus angustifolia}). We found three main results: 1) bark
roughness and lichen communities displayed signficant responses to
tree genotype, 2) tree genotype contributed to lichen network
structure, explaining a third of the variation in lichen interaction
networks, and 3) different aspects of lichen network structure,
including the number of interactions and centralization, responded to
tree genotype, primarily as a function of the number of species
present and to a lesser extent the abundance of lichen. We conclude
that tree genotype influences lichen interaction network structure
with one potential pathway being that bark roughness alters the
presence and overall abundance of lichen, which determines the nature
and magnitude of interactions in the community. These results support
the hypothesis that variation in ecological interaction networks can
result from genetically based variation in foundation species. This
study opens the possibility for a genetic basis to both direct and
indirect interactions among species in complex communities.

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species. In ecological communities, community dynamics
depend on key interactions \cite{Fontaine2011} that occur in species
interaction networks, such as:  trophic \cite{Bascompte2006,
  Johnson2008, Johnson2009} and mutualistic \cite{Rafferty2013}
interaction networks. Phylogenetic patterns in ecological networks
support the importance of evolutionary processes in shaping species
interactions, community structure and ecosystem processes
\cite{Crutsinger2016, Rezende2007, Whitham2006a}.

Elamo1999 = fungi

Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit2015a} have shown that
genetic variation in foundation species \cite{Ellison2005} plays a
significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting
organisms:  such as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and
soil microbes. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that genetic
variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical,
phenological, morphological) produces a multivariate phenotype
\cite{holeski2012} that contributes to variation in associated
communities \cite{Bailey2009a}.

Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species but it also impacts the structure of the network of
species interactions in these communities \cite{Keith2017,
  Lau2015a}. Also, work by \citep{Toju2017, Toju2016, Toju2014a}
observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species
modules focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
have disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and
likely are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure
and dynamics.


Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichen species. Using a long-term (20+
years), common garden experiment with replicated individuals of known
genetic identity and a naturally established stand of \textit{Populus
  angustifolia}. We focused on a model community of 9 epiphytic
lichens species, as previous research has demonstrated significant
compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic variation
\cite{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition, the life-history
characteristics of lichen, having highly localized, direct contact
interactions and slow population turnover rates, allowed us to assess
interactions among lichen species on individual trees. We hypothesize
that in natural systems evolution occurs in a community context
involving interactions of complex networks of interacting species
\cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017, Thompson2013, Bascompte2006}.  If correct,
we should expect to find that network structure is genetically based
in which different plant genotypes support different interaction
networks and that these interactions networks can function as
indicators of ecological dynamics important for conserving
biodiversity.  Applying a probability-theory based network modeling
approach, we constructed a set of interaction network models for the
lichen associated with individual trees. Using these models, we then
examined the genetic basis of the structure of these ecological
networks.

\matmethods{


The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled in order to avoid the effect of
the hybridization between these two species \cite{Zinkgraf2016}. Bark
lichen have been extensively study in this system previously, and
provide an ideal system in which to observe and model lichen
interaction networks, as their sessile nature permits accurate
identification of individuals \cite{Lamit2011}.

\textbf{Need to add more citations of Lamits or other lichen studies.}

A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect
of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment
associated with each individual and spatial
autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted randomly in a single field (0.025 km$^2$) at
the Ogden Nature Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established
individuals in the common garden, we chose a total of thirteen
genotypes, replicated between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling. In
this study, we use the genotype notations previously published in
\citep{Martinsen1991}.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen Observations}

On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichen, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 10 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and 85
cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A and
B). The bark lichen community in this system is comprised of fourteen
species; however, only 9 species were observed within our study
quadrats (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} C-K). The observed lichen
community included (abbreviations are given for species present in
study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza galericulata}, Xm =
\textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa}, Cs =
\textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg = \textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh =
\textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Pm = \textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa =
\textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu = \textit{Physcia undulata}. Several
other species were not obesrved in the present study but are known to
occur in this region:  \textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis},
\textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata}, \textit{Melanelia subolivacea},
\textit{Meanelia elegantula}. Species accumulation curves indicated
that communities in the the common garden were thoroughly sampled and
similar in composition and richness to nearby naturally established
cottonwood stands (Supplementary Materials).

The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (S.E.) (see Supplementary
Fig~\ref{fig:SI_xg_median}). Based on this, we expected thalli
observed in each cell to generally be spatially independent of the
other cells in the quadrat but exposed to similar micro-environmental
conditions created by the bark and the location of the sampling area
on an individual tree. Therefore, we were confident in treating the
cell-wise observations in quadrats as independent with respect to
lichen-lichen interactions.

As bark roughness had previously been shown to be an important,
genetically based tree trait impacting bark lichen, we measured the
percentage of rough bark on each tree following the methods of
\citep{Lamit2011}. Briefly, the number of cells containing disrupted,
fissured bark were counted within each quadrat on each tree. The
number of rough bark containing cells were then summed and divided by
the total number of cells surveyed. This was done for all quadrats on
all trees in which lichen communities were also observed.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

We used the observations of lichen in the 1cm2 cells on individual
trees of \textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated
using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another
species $P(S_i | S_j)$, based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
$P(S_i)$ and the joint probability of co-occurrences $P(S_i,S_j)$
using the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We
were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each
species pair as $P(S_i|S_j) = \frac{P(S_i,S_j)}{P(S_j)}$, based on the
axioms of probability. This yielded an asymetric matrix, that is
$P(S_i|S_j)$ does not have to be equal to $P(S_j|S_i)$, that also had
a diagonal $S_{ii}$ equal to one for all species present and zero for
species that were not observed on the tree.

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant
links between species. This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_i,S_j)$) is different from
zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}).  Here, a confidence interval
$CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j] * Z_{95\%} *
\sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E($S_iS_j$) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$) times the
independent probabilities of each species $P(S_i) * P(S_j)$,
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells times
the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_i,S_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_i,S_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability $P(S_i,S_j)$ is determined to be equal
to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i) \dot
P(S_j)$), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species $P(S_i)$. Therefore, unless the
co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence interval,
the probability that the observation of one species given the other is
no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting
conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities
from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional
probability is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero. The
resulting matrix ($\mathbf{D} = D_{ij}$) can be interpreted as how one
species impacts another with zero being no effect and values less than
or greater than zero interpreted as negative and positive effects,
respectively. Here, we will refer to this matrix ($\mathbf{D}$) as an
interaction matrix with the properties that it can be asymetric
(i.e. $P_{ij}$ does not necessarily equal $P_{ji}$), and the diagonal
($P_{ii}$) is zero (i.e. a species does not influence it's own
probability of being observed).

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lcn_araujo_method.pdf}
\caption{Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting
  field observations in 1 cm$^2$ cells within a 10 cm$^2$ grid on each
  tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of $N$
  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,
  $P(S_i|S_j)$, for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to
  zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, $P(S_i S_j)$, were
  not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of
  their observed co-occurrence frequency, $S_iS_j$, to that expected
  due to chance alone, $E[P(S_iS_j)] = P(S_i) P(S_j)$, and
  $P(S_i|S_j)$ reduces to $P(S_i)$, the observed individual
  probability of species $S_i$.}

\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of
genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction
networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we
used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML). We used a combination of Least Squares Regression,
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark roughness,
lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet
the assumptions of heterogeneity of variance and heteroskedasticity for
these tests. 

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community
composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate
statistical approaches, including Permutational Analysis of Variance
(PerMANOVA) and Mantel tests. For all analyses, community composition
was relativized by species maxima to reduce the effect of the highly
abundant \textit{X. galericulata}. For community composition we used
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, which has optimal performance with count
data \citep{Minchen1998}. To quantify the similarity of lichen
networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise Euclidean
distance of the $\mathbf{D}$ interaction matrices among all pairs of
trees.

For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) \cite{ecodist} to produce
dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multi-variate responses and
fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values \cite{vegan}. Using random initial configurations with a
maximum of 500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less
than 10$^{-12}$. Final configurations has the lowest stress with at
most a stress level of 0.10.


For each network, we also calculated two network metrics that measure
different structural aspects. We calculated the number of interactions
or ``links'' in each network, which provides a measure of the size of
the network \citep{Lau2015, Borrett2015}. We also calculated the
centralization of each network, which measures the evenness of the
distribution of interactions among the species in the network
\cite{Butts2005}. In a network with a low level of centralization
species have similar amount of interaction in the network, while a
network with a high level of centralization tends to one or small
subset of species that interact with other species. We used a related
function to calculate the centrality of each species in each network
as well. Although there are many other metrics, see \citep{Lau2017a},
we focus on a subset for the sake of simplicity and because some
metrics are not appropriate for our relatively small communities. In
particular, we do not present analysis of the modularity (i.e. the
degree of sub-grouping) because our community has relatively few
species to form modules. As with the other response variables, the
number of links was log-transformed and centralization scores were
square-root transformed to meet variance and normality assumptions.

We have made all code and data available online. Code is available at
\url{github.com/communitygenetics/lcn}. Data is available via the
Harvard Dataverse (needs project ID). The project is also archived via
Zenodo at \url{zenodo.com/doiXXXXXX}. All analyses were conducted
using the programming language R version 3.4.2 (R Development Core
Team 2018).

\end{figure}


Bark roughness and lichen communities responded to tree
genotype. Percent rough bark varied significantly among genotypes
(REML $R^2$ = 0.378, RLRT = 10.69, $p$-value = 0.0001), as did total
lichen cover (REML $R^2$ = 0.172, RLRT = 2.9627, $p$-value =
0.0375).However, lichen species richness did not show a significant
response to genotype (REML $R^2$ = 0.0981, RLRT = 1.0001, $p$-value =
0.1366). Community composition was also affected by tree genotype
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.243, F 12 = 1.8221, $p$-value = 0.0029). In
addition, community composition was correlated with bark roughness
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.039, $F_1$ = 3.7408, $p$-value = 0.0064), lichen
cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.342, $F_1$ = 32.8482, $p$-value = 0.0001)
and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.069, $F_1$ = 6.5958,
$p$-value = 0.0002) (Fig.~\ref{fig:com_ch_plot}). However, after
controlling for the effect of tree genotype on community composition,
bark roughness did not significantly predict community composition
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.011, F 1 = 0.9938, $p$-value = 0.3841) but lichen
cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.236, $F_1$ = 21.2661, $p$-value = 0.0001)
and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.054, $F_1$ = 4.9036,
$p$-value = 0.0011) were still significantly correlated with lichen
composition (Supplementary Tables~\ref{tab:com_ng_perm} and
~\ref{tab:rcom_perm}).

We observed significant lichen network structure. This structure
varied among genotypes (Fig.~\ref{fig:geno_nets}) and lichen species
varied in their importance in the network. \textit{Candaleriella
  subdeflexa} was generally the most central species (i.e. being the
most highly connected) having the highest average centrality (0.73),
followed by \textit{Ca. holocarpa} (0.54) and \textit{L. hageni}
(0.40). The centralization of the remaining species were \textit{R.}
sp. (0.18), \textit{X. galericulata} (0.14), \textit{P. melanchra}
(0.08), \textit{X. montana} (0.06) and \textit{Ph. undulata}
(0.02). \textit{Physcia adscendens} was generally not connected to
other species in the networks and had a centralization score of zero.

Lichen networks observed on trees of the same genotype tended to be
similar in structure. Tree genotype significantly predicted the
similarity of lichen interaction networks (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.33795,
F 12 = 2.5379, $p$-value = 0.0050) (Fig.~\ref{fig:cn_ch_plot}). Bark
roughness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.040, $F_1$ = 4.1680, $p$-value =
0.03770) and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.424, $F_1$ =
44.5034, $p$-value = 9.999e-05) were significant predictors of lichen
network similarity, while total lichen cover was a weak, marginally
significant predictor (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.032, $F_1$ = 3.3573,
$p$-value = 0.06779). However, after controlling for the effect of
tree genotype on lichen network similarity, only species richness was
a significant predictor of lichen network similarity (PerMANOVA $R^2$
= 0.300, $F_1$ = 33.3755, $p$-value = 0.00001), and neither bark
roughness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.019, $F_1$ = 2.0858, $p$-value =
0.14699) nor lichen cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.019, $F_1$ = 2.1504,
$p$-value = 0.14409) were significant predictors (Supplementary
Tables~\ref{tab:cn_ng_perm} and ~\ref{tab:cn_perm}). Community
similarity was not correlated with network similarity (Mantel Spearman
$\rho$ = 0.092, $p$-value = 0.09500).

\end{figure}


The observed genotypic patterns of network similarity could be
summarized by several network metrics. The number of links (PerMANOVA
$R^2$ = 0.392, F 1 = 72.4348, $p$-value = 0.001) and network
centrality (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.309, F 1 = 57.0440, $p$-value = 0.001)
were highly correlated with network similarity.  Tree genotype
significantly predicted network centrality (REML $R^2$ = 0.202, RLRT =
2.7801, $p$-value = 0.04012) but marginally predicted the number of
links (REML $R^2$ = 0.170, RLRT = 2.0484, $p$-value = 0.065)
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cn_metrics}). Total cover was correlated with the
number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ = 6.867, $p$-value = 0.0114) and
centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 8.093, $p$-value = 0.0063). Lichen species
richness was also correlated with the number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ =
29.436, $p$-value = 0.000015) and centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 39.488,
$p$-value < 0.000001). Bark roughness, however, did not significantly
predict either the number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ = 2.897, $p$-value =
0.0946) or the centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 2.591, $p$-value = 0.1134) of
lichen networks (Supplementary Tables~\ref{tab:L_aov} and
~\ref{tab:cen_aov}).

\section*{Discussion}

Our study provides a window into the genetic underpinnings of an
ecological network. We observed significant lichen interaction
structure that varied among genotypes of a foundation tree species,
narrowleaf cottonwood (\textit{P. angustifolia}). We found that a
genetically based trait, bark roughness, partially explained the
variation in lichen interaction networks. Some of this variation in
lichen networks was related to both the overall abundance and species
richness of lichen; though, statistically controlling for the effect
of genotype on these variables indicates that a significant portion of
the variance in lichen species richness is due to a factor other than
tree genotype. By using network metrics, we were also able to probe
for specific characteristics of how these networks were responding to
tree genotype. We found that both number of links and the
centralization of the networks were highly correlated with network
similarity and that tree genotype significantly predicted network
centrality but only marginally predicted the number of network
links. This latter result could be due to the relationship between
species richness and the number of links in the network, which were
significanlty correlated with each other. We also found that bark
roughness did not significantly predict either the number of links or
the centrality of lichen networks, suggesting that bark roughness has
some other effect on the structure of the lichen networks. Taken
together, these findings support the hypothesis that genotypic
variation in a foundation species contributes to the structure of a
network of interacting species.

These findings point to the importance of understanding the community
level effects of genetic variation and highlights the potential for
indirect effects of genetic variation to propagate through networks of
interacting species and trophic levels. This work corroborates
previous findings of the importance of plant genetics in shaping
community structure and ecosystem processes
\cite{Whitham2006a}. Altering the structure of interaction networks
presents a means for genetic effects to be magnified within the system
of interacting species. For example, \citep{Keith2017} showed that the
genetics based interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible
trees resulted in different interaction networks of their associated
arthropod communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of
ecosystems, trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates
of energy and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype.

\textbf{TGW: might be good to cite papers on competition in lichens or
  other organizing factors to back up the least expected statement.
  as epiphytes we might not expect them to care.}

\textbf{TGW: I think we need to emphasize the long-term nature of our
  common garden study as very few common garden studies of lichens
  likely exist. Any refs on this? If true might want to mention this
  up front in intro.}

\textbf{MKL: Environmental filtering is evidenced by species richness,
  but also possibly species interaction varying based on environment
  as networks varied in terms of sign and magnitude as well.}

\textbf{MKL: The effect of bark roughness on network similarity was
  primarily genetically based, and there are likely other factors at
  play.}

\textbf{Discussion of network implications for stability with genetics.}

Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}. In the face of the
high degree of complexity and potential context dependency of
ecological processes, the current study points to the utility of
considering the spatial and temporal scales of interactions, as
discussed to some in previous studies \cite{Bangert2006, Zook2010,
  Zytynska2012}. In the present study, we found that community
assembly processes, such as environmental filtering and species
interactions, are genetically based. This is likely due, in part, to
the large difference in the differences in size and longevity of the
lichen and cottonwood individuals with the trees determining the
environment in which the lichen occur. We suggest that future work
would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with similar differences in body-size
and time-scales. As heritable variation is the raw material for
natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer
to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex communities.
