Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure across scales from trees to stands, we conducted
quantitative modeling of interaction network for a community of
epiphytic lichens in a long-term experimental common garden of
genotyped trees of a foundation species (\textit{Populus
  angustifolia}). We found three main results: 1) Tree genotype
strongly contributed to network structure explaining over a third of
the variation in lichen interaction networks, 2) Multiple aspects of
interaction network structure varied in response to genotype,
including network size, the number of interactions, linkage density
and connectance, 3) At the stand scale, we also found signficant
modular structure of plant-lichen networks resulting in part from the
combination of trees of the same genotype tending to have similar
community compositions and supporting similar lichen interaction
networks dominated by positive interactions. These results support the
hypothesis that variation in ecological interaction networks can
result from genetically based variation in foundation
species. Although these results are for a community of sessile
organisms in close proximity to the tree, this study opens the
possibility for a genetic basis to both direct and indirect
interactions among species in complex communities.

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species. In ecological communities, community dynamics
depend on key interactions \cite{Fontaine2011} that occur in species
interaction networks, such as:  trophic \cite{Bascompte2006} and
mutualistic \cite{Rafferty2013} interaction networks. Phylogenetic
patterns in ecological networks support the importance of evolutionary
processes in shaping species interactions, community structure and
ecosystem processes \cite{Crutsinger 2016, Rezende2007,
  Whitham2006a}. Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit et al. 2015}
have shown that genetic variation in foundation species
\cite{Ellison2005} plays a significant role in defining distinct
communities of interacting organisms:  such as, endophytes, pathogens,
lichens, arthropods, and soil microbes. Multiple studies have now
demonstrated that genetic variation influences numerous functional
traits (e.g., phytochemical, phenological, morphological) produces a
multivariate phenotype \cite{holeski2012} tha contributes to variation
in associated communities \cite{Bailey2009a}.


Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species but it also impacts the structure of the network of
species interactions in these communities \cite{Keith2017,
  Lau2016}. Also, work by \citep{Toju 2018, Toju2015, Toju2014}
observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species
modules focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
have disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and
likely are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure
and dynamics.

Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of lichen species. Using a long-term (20 years+), common
garden experiment with replicated individuals of known genetic
identity and a naturally established stand of
\textit{P. angustifolia}. We focused on a model community of 9
epiphytic lichens species, as previous research has demonstrated
significant compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic
variation \cite{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition, the
life-history characteristics of lichen, having highly localized,
direct contact interactions and slow population turnover rates,
allowed us to assess interactions among lichen species on individual
trees. We hypothesize that in natural systems evolution occurs in a
community context involving interactions of complex networks of
interacting species \cite{Lau2016, Keith2017, Thompson2013,
  Bascompte2007, Darwin1855}.  If correct, we should expect to find
that network structure is genetically based in which different plant
genotypes support different interaction networks and that these
interactions networks can function as indicators of ecological
dynamics important for conserving biodiversity.  Applying a dual-scale
(lichen-lichen and genotype-lichen interactions) network modeling and
analyses, we then examined the genetically based impacts of
\textit{P. angustifolia} on network structure.

\subsection*{Field observations in common garden and natural riparian forest stands}

The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled in order to avoid the effect of
the hybridization between these two species.

A common garden was used to isolate the effect of tree genotype from
the effect of the localized microenvironment associated with each
individual and spatial autocorrelation. Asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted randomly in a single field (0.025 km$^2$) at
the Ogden Nature Center, Ogden, UT in 1992. A total of thirteen
genotypes replicated between 3 and 8 times each, were chosen for
sampling. Genotype names were previously published in
\citep{Martinsen}.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen Observations}

The bark lichen community in this system is comprised of fourteen
species; however, only 9 species were observed within our study
quadrats. The lichen community included (abbreviations are given for
species present in study): Xg = Xanthomendoza galericulata, Xm =
X. montana, Ch = Caloplaca holocarpa, Cs = Candelariella subdeflexa,
Rg = Rinodina glauca, Lh = Lecanora hagenii, Ls = Lecanora (unknown
species), Pm = Phyciella melanchra, Pa = Physcia adscendens, Pu =
Physcia undulata, Phaeophyscia orbicularis, Phaeophyscia ciliata,
Melanelia subolivacea, Meanelia elegantula, including both crustose
and foliose lichen species that exhibit low inter-annual
variation5. We were able to rapidly assess lichen interactions by
quantifying thalli in closed contact as assessed using 1cm2
cells. Species accumulation curves showed that communities in the wild
and the common garden were thoroughly sampled and with very similar
species richness (Supplementary Materials). 

On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm2 cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Sampling
was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk to maximize the
abundance of lichen and control for the effect of trunk aspect. Two
adjacent 10 cm2 quadrats centered at 50 cm and 85 cm from ground level
were sampled. The checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
each cell based on an average thallus size of 1 cm2. The thalli in
each cell are expected to be spatially independent of the other cells
in the quadrat, but exposed to similar micro-environmental conditions
created by the bark and the location of the sampling area on an
individual tree.

As bark roughness had previously been shown to be an important,
genetically based, tree trait impacting this lichen community, we
measured the percentage of rough bark on each tree following the
methods of \citep{Lamit2012}. Briefly, the number of cells containing
disrupted, fissured bark were counted within each quadrat on each
tree. The number of rough bark containing cells were then summed and
divided by the total number of cells surveyed.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

We used the observations of lichen in the 1cm2 cells on individual
trees of \textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated
using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another
species ($P(A | B)$), based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
($P(A)$) and the joint probability of co-occurrences ($P(A,B)$) using
the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We were then
able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each species pair
as $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$, based on the axioms of
probability. This yielded an asymetric matrix, that is $P(A|B)$ does
not have to be equal to $P(B|A)$ with a trace equal to the identity
matrix (i.e. $P(A|A) = 1$). 

Once these network matrices were constructed using the conditional
probabilities of species pairs, we then applied an analytical
procedure to remove non-significant links between species
(Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}). This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(A,B)$) is different from zero.
If the frequency of co-occurrences ($AB$) falls outside of the
interval ($CI_{95\%}$), the joint probability is inferred to be
non-zero. Here, $CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E(AB) *
Z_{95\%} * \sqrt{V(AB)}$, where the expected frequency of
co-occurrences (E($AB$)) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$)
times the independent probabilities of each species ($P_A * P_B$),
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(AB)$ is the total number of cells times the
expected probability of $AB$ and its compliment (i.e. $V(AB) = N *
P(AB) * (1 - P(AB))$). Since the conditional probability is calculated
using the joint probability as the numerator, whenever the joint
probability is determined to be zero the conditional probability is
determined to also be zero, since $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)} =
\frac{0}{P(B)} = 0$.

\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

A correlation test with Pearson’s r was used to test for the
correlation between the wild and common garden networks. A Welch
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), which relaxes the assumption of
homogeneity of variance, was used to test for the effects of genotype
on tree scale SES values. A permutation based Mantel Test was used to
test for the effect of bark roughness on SES values in the common
garden. All analyses were conducted using the programming language R
version 3.0.2 (R Development Core Team 2014).

\section*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rehash of results support hypothesis of genetic basis to network structure
\item Genotypic environmental filtering leads to altered interaction
  network structure and potentially dymanics
\item Indirect effects of genotypes (G -> rough -> cover -> richness
  -> links -> networks)
\item Importance of indirect effects and complexity and releveance to IIGEs
\item Conclusion
\end{itemize}



Trait variation + assembly + ecosystem function

These findings support the hypothesis that genotypic variation in a
foundation species contributes to the structure of a network of
interacting species that might be least expected to exhibit such
structure. 

\textbf{TGW: MIGHT BE GOOD TO CITE PAPERS ON COMEPTITION IN LICHENS OR
OTHER ORGANIZING FACTORS TO BACK UP THE LEAST EXPECTED STATEMENT.  AS
EPIPHYTES WE MIGHT NOT EXPECT THEM TO CARE.}

\textbf{MKL: This is a job for Lamit and Rikke.}

Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the wild
stand showed significant interaction network structure (Fig. 1a and
b); and both tree genotype and the genetically based tree trait, bark
roughness, was a strong predictor of co-occurrence patterns
(Fig. 2a). 

\textbf{TGW: I THINK WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF OUR
COMMON GARDEN STUDY AS VERY FEW COMMON GARDEN STUDIES OF LICHENS
LIKELY EXIST. ANY REFS ON THIS? IF TRUE MIGHT WANT TO MENTION THIS UP
FRONT IN INTRO.}

\textbf{MKL: Same here. This is a job for Lamit and Rikke.}

Second, in a long-term common garden study, network
(Fig. 1b) structure showed a high degree of similarity to the wild
stand network structure (Fig. 1c and d). Third, tree genotype was a
significant predictor of SES values (Fig. 2a), displaying significant
correlation with a genetically linked trait, bark roughness, both in
the common garden (Fig. 2a) and in a naturally established stand of
trees (Fig. 2b). Last, both of the bipartite genotype-species networks
in the common garden and natural stand displayed significant
modularity, suggesting that genotypic variation is leading to the
formation of evolutionarily dynamic compartments within the
community. Thus, just as numerous studies have shown that plant
genotype can affect species richness, abundance, diversity, and
composition and previous work has demonstrated that evolutionary
processes shape ecological networks \cite{Guimaraes2011,
  Moya-Larano2011}, our study includes genetics in an empirical
investigation that combines both experimental common garden findings
along with studies in the wild that are in close agreement.

Our results point to the importance of understanding the community
level effects of genetic variation and corroborate previous findings
of the importance of plant genetics in shaping community structure and
ecosystem processes \cite{Whitham2006a}.  This study highlights the
potential for indirect effects of genetic variation to propagate
through networks of interacting species and trophic levels. Altering
the structure of interaction networks presents a means for genetic
effects to be magnified within the system of interacting species. For
example, Keith et al. (2017) showed that the genetics based
interations of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible trees resulted in
different interaction networks of their associated arthropod
communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of ecosystems,
trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates of energy
and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype.

\subsection{Units of evolutionary potential: Moving beyond species pairs}


Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}, although spatial
scale of interactions should be considered \cite{Zook2010} Bangert et
al. 2006. As heritable variation is the raw material for natural
selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer

%% \subsection*{Supporting Information (SI)}

%% Authors should submit SI as a single separate PDF file, combining
%% all text, figures, tables, movie legends, and SI references.  PNAS
%% will publish SI uncomposed, as the authors have provided it.
%% Additional details can be found here:
%% \href{http://www.pnas.org/page/authors/journal-policies}{policy on
%% SI}.  For SI formatting instructions click
%% \href{https://www.pnascentral.org/cgi-bin/main.plex?form_type=display_auth_si_instructions}{here}.
%% The PNAS Overleaf SI template can be found
%% \href{https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/pnas-template-for-supplementary-information/wqfsfqwyjtsd}{here}.
%% Refer to the SI Appendix in the manuscript at an appropriate point
%% in the text. Number supporting figures and tables starting with S1,
%% S2, etc.

%% Authors who place detailed materials and methods in an SI Appendix
%% must provide sufficient detail in the main text methods to enable a
%% reader to follow the logic of the procedures and results and also
%% must reference the SI methods. If a paper is fundamentally a study
%% of a new method or technique, then the methods must be described
%% completely in the main text.

%% \subsubsection*{SI Datasets} 

%% Supply Excel (.xls), RTF, or PDF files. This file type will be
%% published in raw format and will not be edited or composed.

%% \subsubsection*{SI Movies}

%% Supply Audio Video Interleave (avi), Quicktime (mov), Windows Media
%% (wmv), animated GIF (gif), or MPEG files and submit a brief legend
%% for each movie in a Word or RTF file. All movies should be
%% submitted at the desired reproduction size and length. Movies
%% should be no more than 10 MB in size.


%% \subsubsection*{3D Figures}

%% Supply a composable U3D or PRC file so that it may be edited and
%% composed. Authors may submit a PDF file but please note it will be
%% published in raw format and will not be edited or composed.
