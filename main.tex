\begin{abstract}

Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure across scales from trees to stands, we conducted
quantitative modeling of interaction network for a community of
epiphytic lichens in a long-term experimental common garden of
genotyped trees of a foundation species (\textit{Populus
  angustifolia}). We found three main results: 1) Tree genotype
strongly contributed to network structure explaining over a third of
the variation in lichen interaction networks, 2) Multiple aspects of
interaction network structure varied in response to genotype,
including network size, the number of interactions, linkage density
and connectance, 3) At the stand scale, we also found signficant
modular structure of plant-lichen networks resulting in part from the
combination of trees of the same genotype tending to have similar
community compositions and supporting similar lichen interaction
networks dominated by positive interactions. These results support the
hypothesis that variation in ecological interaction networks can
result from genetically based variation in foundation
species. Although these results are for a community of sessile
organisms in close proximity to the tree, this study opens the
possibility for a genetic basis to both direct and indirect
interactions among species in complex communities.

\section*{Introduction}


\section*{Methods}

\subsection*{Field observations in common garden and natural riparian
  forest stands}

The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled in order to avoid the effect of
the hybridization between these two species.

A common garden was used to isolate the effect of tree genotype from
the effect of the localized microenvironment associated with each
individual and spatial autocorrelation. Asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted randomly in a single field (0.025 km$^2$) at
the Ogden Nature Center, Ogden, UT in 1992. A total of thirteen
genotypes replicated between 3 and 8 times each, were chosen for
sampling. Genotype names were previously published
\cite{Martinsen}. Observations were made in the common garden in
October 2010 and May 2011.

\caption{Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting
  field observations in 1 cm$^2$ cells within a 10 cm$^2$ grid on each
  tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of $N$
  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  a null-model based procedure \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated and
  removed non-significant ($\alpha = 0.05$) co-occurrences to produce
  the network associated with an individual tree.}
