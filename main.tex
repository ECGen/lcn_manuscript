Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure, we conducted quantitative modeling of interaction
network for a community of epiphytic lichens in a long-term
experimental common garden of genotyped trees of a foundation species
(\textit{Populus angustifolia}). We found three main results: 1) bark
roughness and lichen communities displayed signficant responses to
tree genotype, 2) tree genotype strongly contributed to network
structure, explaining a third of the variation in lichen interaction
networks, and 3) several metrics of interaction network structure
varied in response to genotype, including the number of interactions
and centralization. These results support the hypothesis that
variation in ecological interaction networks can result from
genetically based variation in foundation species. This study opens
the possibility for a genetic basis to both direct and indirect
interactions among species in complex communities.

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species. In ecological communities, community dynamics
depend on key interactions \cite{Fontaine2011} that occur in species
interaction networks, such as:  trophic \cite{Bascompte2006} and
mutualistic \cite{Rafferty2013} interaction networks. Phylogenetic
patterns in ecological networks support the importance of evolutionary
processes in shaping species interactions, community structure and
ecosystem processes \cite{Crutsinger2016, Rezende2007, Whitham2006a}. 

More on ecological networks 

Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit2015} have shown that
genetic variation in foundation species \cite{Ellison2005} plays a
significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting
organisms:  such as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and
soil microbes. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that genetic
variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical,
phenological, morphological) produces a multivariate phenotype
\cite{holeski2012} tha contributes to variation in associated
communities \cite{Bailey2009a}.

Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species but it also impacts the structure of the network of
species interactions in these communities \cite{Keith2017,
  Lau2016}. Also, work by \citep{Toju2018, Toju2015, Toju2014}
observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species
modules focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
have disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and
likely are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure
and dynamics.

Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichen species. Using a long-term (20+
years), common garden experiment with replicated individuals of known
genetic identity and a naturally established stand of \textit{Populus
  angustifolia}. We focused on a model community of 9 epiphytic
lichens species, as previous research has demonstrated significant
compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic variation
\cite{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition, the life-history
characteristics of lichen, having highly localized, direct contact
interactions and slow population turnover rates, allowed us to assess
interactions among lichen species on individual trees. We hypothesize
that in natural systems evolution occurs in a community context
involving interactions of complex networks of interacting species
\cite{Lau2016, Keith2017, Thompson2013, Bascompte2007, Darwin1855}.
If correct, we should expect to find that network structure is
genetically based in which different plant genotypes support different
interaction networks and that these interactions networks can function
as indicators of ecological dynamics important for conserving
biodiversity.  Applying a probability-theory based network modeling
approach, we constructed a set of interaction network models for the
lichen associated with individual trees. Using these models, we then
examined the genetic basis a foundation tree species on the structure
of ecological networks.

\matmethods{


The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled in order to avoid the effect of
the hybridization between these two species \cite{Zinkgraf2016}.

A common garden was used to isolate the effect of tree genotype from
the effect of the localized microenvironment associated with each
individual and spatial autocorrelation. Asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted randomly in a single field (0.025 km$^2$) at
the Ogden Nature Center, Ogden, UT in 1992. A total of thirteen
genotypes replicated between 3 and 8 times each, were chosen for
sampling. Genotype names were previously published in
\citep{Martinsen}.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen Observations}

On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichen, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 10 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and 85
cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A and
B). The bark lichen community in this system is comprised of fourteen
species; however, only 9 species were observed within our study
quadrats (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} C-K). The observed lichen
community included (abbreviations are given for species present in
study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza galericulata}, Xm =
\textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa}, Cs =
\textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg = \textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh =
\textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Ls = \textit{Lecanora} sp., Pm =
\textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa = \textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu =
\textit{Physcia undulata}. Several other species were not obesrved in
the present study but are known to occur in this region:
\textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis}, \textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata},
\textit{Melanelia subolivacea}, \textit{Meanelia elegantula}. Species
accumulation curves indicated that communities in the the common
garden were thoroughly sampled and similar in composition and richness
to nearby naturally established cottonwood stands (Supplementary
Materials).

The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (S.E.) \cite{Lamit2015}. Based on this, we
expected thalli observed in each cell to generally be spatially
independent of the other cells in the quadrat but exposed to similar
micro-environmental conditions created by the bark and the location of
the sampling area on an individual tree. Therefore, we were confident
in treating the cell-wise observations in quadrats as independent with
respect to lichen-lichen interactions.

As bark roughness had previously been shown to be an important,
genetically based tree trait impacting bark lichen, we measured the
percentage of rough bark on each tree following the methods of
\citep{Lamit2012}. Briefly, the number of cells containing disrupted,
fissured bark were counted within each quadrat on each tree. The
number of rough bark containing cells were then summed and divided by
the total number of cells surveyed. This was done for all quadrats on
all trees in which lichen communities were also observed.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

We used the observations of lichen in the 1cm2 cells on individual
trees of \textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated
using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another
species ($P(A | B)$), based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
($P(A)$) and the joint probability of co-occurrences ($P(A,B)$) using
the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We were then
able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each species pair
as $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A,B)}{P(B)}$, based on the axioms of
probability. This yielded an asymetric matrix, that is $P(A|B)$ does
not have to be equal to $P(B|A)$ with a trace equal to the identity
matrix (i.e. $P(A|A) = 1$). 

Once these network matrices were constructed using the conditional
probabilities of species pairs, we then applied an analytical
procedure to remove non-significant links between species
(Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}). This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_iS_j)$) is different from
zero.  If the frequency of co-occurrences ($S_iS_j$) falls outside of
the interval ($CI_{95\%}$), the joint probability is inferred to be
non-zero. Here, $CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j]
* Z_{95\%} * \sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of
co-occurrences (E($S_iS_j$)) is the total number of cells surveyed
($N$) times the independent probabilities of each species ($P(S_i) *
P(S_j)$), $Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and
the expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells
times the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_iS_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_iS_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability ($P(S_iS_j)$) is determined to be
equal to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i)
\dot P(S_j)$, and the conditional probability reduces to the
individual probability of that species ($P(S_i)$). Therefore, unless
the co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence
interval, the probability that the observation of one species given
the other is no different than simply observing that species
alone. This enables us to remove links from a given network by
re-scaling the resulting conditional probabilities by subtracting the
individual probabilities from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how
different the conditional probability is from the independent
probability), which makes any species with a non-signficant
conditional probability zero. The resulting matrix ($D_{ij}$) can be
interpreted as how one species impacts another with zero being no
effect and values less than or greater than zero interpreted as
negative and positive effects, respectively.


\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption{Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting
  field observations in 1 cm$^2$ cells within a 10 cm$^2$ grid on each
  tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of $N$
  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,
  $P(S_i|S_j)$, for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to
  zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, $P(S_i S_j)$, were
  not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of
  their observed co-occurrence frequency, $S_iS_j$, to that expected
  due to chance alone, $E[P(S_iS_j)] = P(S_i) P(S_j)$, and
  $P(S_i|S_j)$ reduces to $P(S_i)$, the observed individual
  probability of species $S_i$.}

\caption{}
\label{fig:com_ch_plot}
\end{figure}


Bark roughness and some lichen community characteristics responded to
tree genotype. Percent rough bark varied signficantly among genotypes
(REML RLRT = 10.69, p-value = 3e-04), as did total lichen cover (REML
RLRT = 2.9627, p-value = 0.0375) and community composition (PerMANOVA
$R^2$ = 0.243, F 12 = 1.8221, p-value = 0.0029). However, lichen
species richness did not show a significant response to genotype (REML
RLRT = 0.13047, p-value = 0.3134). Community composition was
correlated with lichen cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.236, F 1 = 21.2661,
p-value = 9.999e-05) and richness (PerMANOVA spr.onc $R^2$ = 0.054, F
1 = 4.9036, p-value = 0.0011) after controlling for tree genotype
effects (Fig.~\ref{fig:com_ch_plot}). Roughness did not predict
community composition (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.011, F 1 = 0.9938, p-value
= 0.3841) even though it was correlated with total lichen cover (ANOVA
$F_{1,55}$ = 6.797, p-value = 0.01173). Roughness was not correlated
with lichen species richness (ANOVA $F_{1, 55}$ = 1.509, p-value =
0.2246).


\subsection*{Tree genotype influenced lichen network similarity}

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cn_onc.pdf}
\caption{Significant lichen interaction networks across genotypes.}
\label{fig:geno_nets}
\end{figure}


We observed significant lichen network structure. This structure
varied among genotypes (Fig.~\ref{fig:geno_nets}) and lichen species
varied in their importance in the network. \textit{Candaleriella
  subdeflexa} was generally the most central species (i.e. being the
most highly connected) having the highest average centrality (0.73),
followed by \textit{Ca. holocarpa} (0.54) and \textit{L. hageni}
(0.40). The centralization of the remaining species were \textit{R.}
sp. (0.18), \textit{X. galericulata} (0.14), \textit{P. melanchra}
(0.08), \textit{X. montana} (0.06) and \textit{Ph. undulata}
(0.02). \textit{Physcia adscendens} was generally not connected to
other species in the networks and had a centralization score of
zero. Interactions tended to be positive (QUANTIFY!!!); however,
\textit{X. galericulata}, although not the most central species,
frequently tended to decrease the presence of other species. 

\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cn_chplot.pdf}
\caption{Significant lichen interaction network structure resulting
  from tree genotypic variation was observed in the common garden.
  The plot shows genotype centroids (points) of NMDS ordinated lichen
  networks ($\pm$ 1 S.E.). Centroids that are closer in ordination
  space are more similar in thee structure of their lichen
  networks. Arrows show the magnitude and direction of correlation of
  the ordinated networks with tree bark roughness (BR), percent cover
  of lichens (PC) and lichen species richness (SR).}
\label{fig:cn_ch_plot}
\end{figure}


Lichen networks observed on trees of the same genotype tended to be
similar in structure. Tree genotype significantly predicted the
similarity of lichen interaction networks (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.33795,
F 12 = 2.5379, p-value = 0.0050). Lichen species richness was also a
significant predictor of network similarity after controlling for
genotype (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.3413, F 1 = 2.5417, p-value = 0.007399);
however, neither total cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.023, F 1 = 2.0628,
p-value = 0.1487) nor roughness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.011, F 1 =
0.0497, p-value = 0.3394) predicted network similiarity
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cn_ch_plot}). Community similiarty was not correlated with
network similiarity (Mantel Rho spearman = 0.012, p-value = 0.337).


\begin{figure}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{cn_metrics.pdf}
\caption{The impact of tree genotype on lichen network structure was
  indicative of variation in both the number variation in lichen
  interactions among species. This Cleveleand plot shows the means and
  standard errors (SE) for two lichen network metrics (number of links
  and centralization) for all genotypes. Both metrics are presented as
  standardized scores ($\frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$).}
\label{fig:cn_metrics}
\end{figure}


These patterns of structural similarity among networks on similar
genotypes could be partially explained by several networks. Tree
genotype marginally predicted the number of links (REML RLRT = 2.0221,
p-value = 0.0657) and centrality (REML RLRT = 2.0915, p-value =
0.0627) of lichen networks (Fig.~\ref{}). Total cover was correlated with the number
of links (ANOVA F 1 = 6.867, p-value = 0.0114) and centrality (ANOVA F
1 = 8.093, p-value = 0.0063). Lichen species richness was also
correlated with the number of links (ANOVA F 1 = 29.436, p-value =
1.46e-06) and centrality (ANOVA F 1 = 39.488, p-value =
6.38e-08). Bark roughness, however, did not significantly predict the
number of links (ANOVA F 1 = 2.897, p-value = 0.0946) nor the
centrality (ANOVA F 1 = 2.591, p-value = 0.1134) of lichen networks.
The number of network links (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.392, F 1 = 72.4348,
p-value = 0.001) and network centrality (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.309, F 1 =
57.0440, p-value = 0.001) were highly correlated with network
similarity.

\section*{Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
\item Rehash of results support hypothesis of genetic basis to network structure
\item Genotypic environmental filtering leads to altered interaction
  network structure and potentially dymanics
\item Indirect effects of genotypes (G - rough - cover - richness -
  links - networks)
\item Importance of indirect effects and complexity and releveance to IIGEs
\item Conclusion
\end{itemize}



Trait variation + assembly + ecosystem function

These findings support the hypothesis that genotypic variation in a
foundation species contributes to the structure of a network of
interacting species that might be least expected to exhibit such
structure. 

\textbf{TGW: MIGHT BE GOOD TO CITE PAPERS ON COMEPTITION IN LICHENS OR
OTHER ORGANIZING FACTORS TO BACK UP THE LEAST EXPECTED STATEMENT.  AS
EPIPHYTES WE MIGHT NOT EXPECT THEM TO CARE.}

\textbf{MKL: This is a job for Lamit and Rikke.}

Several lines of evidence support this conclusion. First, the wild
stand showed significant interaction network structure (Fig. 1a and
b); and both tree genotype and the genetically based tree trait, bark
roughness, was a strong predictor of co-occurrence patterns
(Fig. 2a). 

\textbf{TGW: I THINK WE NEED TO EMPHASIZE THE LONG-TERM NATURE OF OUR
COMMON GARDEN STUDY AS VERY FEW COMMON GARDEN STUDIES OF LICHENS
LIKELY EXIST. ANY REFS ON THIS? IF TRUE MIGHT WANT TO MENTION THIS UP
FRONT IN INTRO.}

\textbf{MKL: Same here. This is a job for Lamit and Rikke.}

Second, in a long-term common garden study, network
(Fig. 1b) structure showed a high degree of similarity to the wild
stand network structure (Fig. 1c and d). Third, tree genotype was a
significant predictor of SES values (Fig. 2a), displaying significant
correlation with a genetically linked trait, bark roughness, both in
the common garden (Fig. 2a) and in a naturally established stand of
trees (Fig. 2b). Last, both of the bipartite genotype-species networks
in the common garden and natural stand displayed significant
modularity, suggesting that genotypic variation is leading to the
formation of evolutionarily dynamic compartments within the
community. Thus, just as numerous studies have shown that plant
genotype can affect species richness, abundance, diversity, and
composition and previous work has demonstrated that evolutionary
processes shape ecological networks \cite{Guimaraes2011,
  Moya-Larano2011}, our study includes genetics in an empirical
investigation that combines both experimental common garden findings
along with studies in the wild that are in close agreement.

Our results point to the importance of understanding the community
level effects of genetic variation and corroborate previous findings
of the importance of plant genetics in shaping community structure and
ecosystem processes \cite{Whitham2006a}.  This study highlights the
potential for indirect effects of genetic variation to propagate
through networks of interacting species and trophic levels. Altering
the structure of interaction networks presents a means for genetic
effects to be magnified within the system of interacting species. For
example, Keith et al. (2017) showed that the genetics based
interations of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible trees resulted in
different interaction networks of their associated arthropod
communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of ecosystems,
trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates of energy
and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype.

\subsection{Units of evolutionary potential: Moving beyond species pairs}


Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}, although spatial
scale of interactions should be considered \cite{Zook2010} Bangert et
al. 2006. As heritable variation is the raw material for natural
selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer
to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex communities.
