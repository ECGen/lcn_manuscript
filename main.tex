Biological evolution occurs in ecosystems whereby natural selection
defines the structure of ecological networks. Therefore, elucidating
the genetic basis to ecological network structure is fundamental to
understanding evolution. Although previous work has demonstrated that
genetic variation can influence food webs and trophic chains, we are
unaware of a study that quantified the contribution of phenotypic
variation to heritable variation in network structure. To examine
this, in a 20+ year common garden we observed nine epiphytic lichen
species associated with narrowleaf cottonwood (\textit{Populus
  angustifolia}), a riparian ecosystem foundation species. We
constructed and conducted genetic analyses of signed, weighted,
directed lichen interaction networks. We found three primary
results. First, genotype identity significantly predicted lichen
network similarity; i.e., replicates of the same genotype supported
more similar lichen networks than different genotypes. Second, broad
sense heritability estimates showed that plant genotype explained
network similarity ($H^2$ = 0.41), degree ($H^2$ = 0.32) and
centralization ($H^2$ = 0.33). Third, of several tree phenotypic
traits examined, bark roughness was both heritable ($H^2$ = 0.32) and
significantly correlated with lichen network similarity ($R^2$ =
0.26). These results support a mechanistic, genetic pathway from
variation in a heritable tree trait to ecological network structure
and demonstrate that evolution can act at the community level to
influence not only abundances of organisms but also interactions at
the scale of entire networks. Given that network structure has
determines system-wide stability and resilience, our findings have
important implications for how evolution acts in ecosystems.

%% Introduction

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex ecological
networks. Community genetics studies have shown that genetic variation
in foundation species, which have large effects on ecosystems by
modulating and stabilizing local conditions \cite{Ellison2005}, plays
a significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting
organisms: such as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and
soil microbes \cite{Busby2015, Barbour2009c, Lamit2015c}. Multiple
studies have now demonstrated that genetic variation influences
numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical, phenological,
morphological) that in combination result in a multivariate functional
trait phenotype \cite{holeski2012} in which individual plant genotypes
support different communities and ecosystem processes
\cite{Bailey2009a, Whitham2012}. Recently, the importance of genetic
variation in structuring ecological systems was reviewed, and not only
were many instances of strong genetic effects found in many ecosystems
but the effect of intraspecific variation was at times greater than
inter-specific variation \cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}. There is
now evidence to support that selection, acting on this heritable
variation, tends to occur among groups of species
\cite{Wade2007TheCommunities} and that genetic variation and
phylogenetic relatedness contribute to variation in community assembly
\cite{Crutsinger2016} and species interactions \cite{Whitham2006a,
  Bailey2009a, Moya-Larano2011}, which shape the structure of
ecological interaction networks \cite{Rezende2007,
  Guimaraes2007InteractionNetworks, Gomez2009LocalMosaic}.

The development of interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGE)
theory \cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE} in evolutionary biology
points to the importance of studying the genetic basis of interaction
network structure because genetic based differences in network
structure among individuals can be acted upon by natural selection
when there are fitness consequences of different networks of IIGEs
that can result in community evolution
\cite{Whitham2020IntraspecificEvolution}. For example, although the
analysis was of abundances rather than interaction networks,
\citep{Gehring2014PlantChange, Gehring2017a} found that the
mycorrhizal communities on the roots of drought tolerant and
intolerant trees are dominated by different orders of ectomycorrhizal
fungal mutualists that also differ in the benefits they provide that
enhance tree performance. Because drought tolerant genotypes are three
times more likely to survive record droughts, selection acts both on
the tree and its fungal community and with increased drought the
community phenotype has changed over time. Also, in an antagonistic
interaction context, \citep{Busby2015} found that with the addition of
a damaging leaf pathogen to cottonwoods in a common garden, the
impacts of these strong interactors results in a different and
diminished community of arthropods relative to control trees. Thus,
selection acting on the tree may alter the network structure of
associated communities in which different networks of communities are
most likely to survive pathogen outbreaks. Regardless of whether the
IIGE is unilateral (i.e., tree affects the community) or reciprocal
(i.e., the community also affects the relative fitness of the tree),
selection on tree, community or both can change network structure
\cite{Whitham2020IntraspecificEvolution} and thereby alter community
dynamics. Network theory and evidence from empirical studies in
ecology have demonstrated that indirect effects can lead to
self-organization, producing sign-changing, amplifying and/or
dampening effects \cite{Newman2006,
  Sole2006Self-OrganizationEcosystems}, and evolutionary applications
have demonstrated that indirect effects of interactions among species
can lead to network structures that amplify or dampen the effects of
selection, such as the formation of star-like structures in which
there is a ``central'' species or group of species that interact with
other, peripheral species, can amplify selection events
\cite{Lieberman2005EvolutionaryGraphs}.


In this context, the ``genetic similarity rule'' provides a useful
framework we can apply to interaction networks at the nexus of
ecological and evolutionary dynamics. In a study combining
experimental common gardens and landscape-scale observations of
interactions between \textit{Populus} spp.  (cottonwoods) and
arthropods, \citep{Bangert2006} observed that individuals genotypes
that are more genetically similar will tend to have similar
phytochemical traits and thus tend to have similar interactions with
other species than individuals that are less similar. However, studies
in the network ecology literature generally do not include a genetic
component \cite{Lau2017a} and community genetics studies have
primarily focused on community composition in terms of the abundance
of species \cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}. Some studies have
examined the effects of genetic variation on trophic chains in
plant-associated communities (including \textit{Populus},
\textit{Solidago}, \textit{Oenothera}, \textit{Salix})
\cite{Bailey2005ImportanceInteractions, Johnson2008, Smith2011,
  Smith2015b, Barbour2016GeneticComplexity} and generally found that
increasing genotypic diversity leads to increased trophic
complexity. Only two other studies, that we are aware of, have
explicitly examined the effect of genotypic variation on the structure
of interaction networks between tree individuals and associated
herbivores \cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017} and both found that genotypic
diversity generates increased network modularity (i.e.,
compartmentalization).  However, both of these studies were examining
networks at the scale of forest stands, rather than networks
associated with individual trees; therefore, neither was able to
observe replicated networks in order to statistically test for genetic
effects on network structure and quantify the genetic component
(i.e. heritable variation) in network structure.

Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichens.  Using a long-term (20+ years),
common garden experiment with clonally replicated \textit{Populus
  angustifolia} individuals of known genetic identity
\cite{Martinsen2001HybridSpecies}. We focused on a community of 9
epiphytic lichen species, as previous research has demonstrated
significant compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic
variation \citep{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. Applying a
probability-theory based network modeling approach, we constructed a
set of interaction network models for the lichens associated with
individual trees. Using these models, we then examined the genetic
basis of the structure of these ecological networks via several
network metrics that measures different aspects of network structure
at the scale of individual species (i.e., nodes) or the entire network
observed on each tree genotype. In particular, we focus the metric of
centrality for individual species and centralization for whole
networks, which measures how much a species is connected in the
network relative to other species. We hypothesize that in natural
systems evolution occurs in a community context involving interactions
of complex networks of interacting species \cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017,
  Thompson2013, Bascompte2006}. More specifically, based on community
genetics theory, particularly the community similarity rule
\citep{Bangert2006}, we hypothesize that trees will co-vary in
functional phenotypic traits, such as bark roughness and chemical
composition, and trees of the same genotype will tend to have similar
traits leading to similarities in lichen network structure. If
correct, we expect to find that network structure is genetically
based, or, in other words, plant genotypes will support different and
heritable interaction networks.

\subsection*{Study System}

The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled. Bark lichens have been
intensively sampled in this system and provide an ideal community in
which to observe and model interaction networks, as their sessile
nature permits accurate identification of individuals and their highly
localized, direct contact interactions and slow population turnover
rates facilitate the assessment of interactions among lichen species
on individual trees \cite{Lamit2011}.

A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect
of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment
associated with each individual and spatial
autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted in fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature
Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established individuals in
the common garden, we chose a total of ten genotypes, replicated
between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling.



\subsection*{Bark Lichen and Trait Observations}


On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichens, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 100 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and
95 cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A
and B). The observed lichen community included (abbreviations are
given for species present in study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza
  galericulata}, Xm = \textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca
  holocarpa}, Cs = \textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg =
\textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh = \textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Pm =
\textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa = \textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu =
\textit{Physcia undulata}. Several other species were not obesrved in
the present study but are known to occur in this region:
\textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis}, \textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata},
\textit{Melanelia subolivacea}, \textit{Meanelia elegantula}.


The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (1 S.E.) (see Supporting Information). Based
on the median thallus size, we expected thalli observed in each cell
to generally be spatially independent of thalli present in other cells
but exposed to similar micro-environmental conditions created by the
bark and the location of the sampling area on an individual
tree. Therefore, we were confident in treating the cell-wise
observations in quadrats as independent with respect to lichen-lichen
interactions. We quantified the texture of the bark in the quadrat is
the percent of 1 cm$^2$ cells with rough bark. In addition to bark
roughness, we also measured several bark chemistry traits by taking
bark samples immediately adjacent to each quadrat using the methods of
\citep{Lamit2011}: including, the concentration of condensed tannins,
pH and carbon and nitrogen concentrations and pH.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

For each tree, repeated observations of lichen were made in order to
construct replicated interaction networks for each genotype. We
conducted a modified sampling procedure originally developed by
\citep{Lamit2015a} with the addition that we quantified the presence
of lichen in the 1 cm$^2$ cells on individual trees of
\textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated using the
conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the probability
of observing one species given an observation of another species
$P(S_i | S_j)$, based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
$P(S_i)$ and the joint probability of co-occurrences $P(S_i, S_j)$
using the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We
were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each
species pair as $P(S_i|S_j) = \frac{P(S_i,S_j)}{P(S_j)}$, based on the
axioms of probability. This yielded a matrix that could possibly be
asymmetric, i.e. $P(S_i|S_j)$ does not have to be equal to
$P(S_j|S_i)$. Another important property of this matrix is that the
diagonal, $P(S_{i} | S_{i})$, was equal to one for all species present
and zero for species that were not observed in any cell.

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant
links between species. This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_i,S_j)$) is different from
zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}).  Here, a confidence interval
$CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j] * Z_{95\%} *
\sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E($S_iS_j$) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$) times the
independent probabilities of each species $P(S_i) * P(S_j)$,
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells times
the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_i,S_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_i,S_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability $P(S_i,S_j)$ is determined to be equal
to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i) \dot
P(S_j)$), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species $P(S_i)$. Therefore, unless the
co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence interval,
the probability that the observation of one species given the other is
no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting
conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities
from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional
probability is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero. 

The resulting matrix ($\mathbf{D} = D_{ij}$) can be interpreted as one
species' impact on another with zero being no effect and values less
than or greater than zero being negative and positive effects,
respectively. Here, we will refer to $\mathbf{D}$ as a signed,
weighted interaction matrix. As such, $\mathbf{D}$ has the properties
that it can be asymmetric (i.e. $D_{ij}$ does not necessarily equal
$D_{ji}$) and it scales between -1 and 1, and, therefore, does not
have the mathematical properties of a probabilistic network
\cite{Poisot2016TheNetworks}. Also, as the method does not track
individuals within species and interactions such as competitive
exclusion or facilitation within species would result in the same
species being observed. Therefore, the results of intra-specific
interactions always results in the same species being observed and a
resulting $D_{ii} = 0$.

\begin{figure*}[ht]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{lcn_araujo_method.pdf}
\caption{Lichen interaction networks were constructed by conducting
  field observations in 1 cm$^2$ cells within a 100 cm$^2$ grid on each
  tree using a checkerboard pattern (grey cells). Thus, a set of $N$
  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,
  $P(S_i|S_j)$, for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to
  zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, $P(S_i S_j)$, were
  not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of
  their observed co-occurrence frequency, $S_iS_j$, to that expected
  due to chance alone, $E[P(S_iS_j)] = P(S_i) P(S_j)$, and
  $P(S_i|S_j)$ reduces to $P(S_i)$, the observed individual
  probability of species $S_i$. In the context of these networks,
  asymmetry and positive/negative valued connections are distinct
  quantities. In-coming and out-going connections can be interpreted
  as ``influenced by'' and ``influenced'', respectively; while
  positive and negative should be seen as one species increasing or
  decreasing, respectively, the probability of another species'
  occurrence.}
\label{fig:conet_method}
\end{figure*}


\subsection*{Network Metrics}

To quantify the structural variation of lichen networks we calculated
several metrics at both the node and whole-network level. For
individual nodes (i.e. species) in each network, we calculated both
the degree and the Freeman's centrality \cite{sna}. We also calculated
two similar global network metrics: degree and centralization. The
first was network degree, which is a count of the total number of
links in a network. As the networks contained not only positive and
negative connections but also directional connections (both in-coming
and out-going), we calculated the same network metrics for all
combinations of these types of connections in each network, accounting
for differences in sign through the application of recently developed
metrics that incoporate sign information from signed, weighted,
directed networks \cite{Everett2014NetworksTies}. Although there are
many more possible network metrics that could have been examined, we
chose to focus on a restricted set for the sake of clarity. In
addition, degree and centrality form the basis of many other network
metrics.


\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of
genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction
networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we
used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML). We used a combination of Least Squares Regression,
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark roughness,
lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet
the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality for these
tests.

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community
composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate
statistical approaches, including Permutational Analysis of Variance
(PERMANOVA) and Mantel tests. To quantify the similarity of lichen
networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise Euclidean
distance of the $\mathbf{D}$ interaction matrices among all pairs of
trees.

For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) \cite{ecodist} to produce
dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multi-variate responses and
fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values \cite{vegan}. Using random initial configurations with a
maximum of 500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less
than 10$^{-12}$. Final configurations has the lowest stress with at
most a stress level of 0.10.

For each network, we also calculated metrics that measure different
structural aspects. Although there are many other metrics, for the
sake of simplicity we focus on a subset that represent several
interesting features of network structure (see \citep{Lau2017a}). We
calculated the number of interactions or ``links'' in each network,
which provides a measure of the size of the network \citep{Lau2015a,
  Borrett2014EnaR:Analysis}. We also calculated the centralization of
each network, which measures the evenness of the distribution of
interactions among the species in the network \cite{sna}. In a network
with a low level of centralization species have similar amount of
interaction in the network, while a network with a high level of
centralization tends to have one or small number of species that
interact with other species. We used a related function to calculate
the centrality of each species (i.e. node level centrality) in each
network as well. To calculate separate metrics for positive and
negative links, we applied methods for calculating the centrality
accounting for the sign differences \cite{Everett2014NetworksTies}
using the \texttt{signnet} package \cite{siggnet}.

For all tests where genotype was used as a predictor, we quantified
the heritability of the response variable. Because the trees in the
garden were clonal replicates of each genotype, we calculated
broad-sense heritability, which is the genotypic variance divided by
the total phenotypic variance \cite{Conner2004ATextbook}. This can be
interpreted as a measure of the phenotypic variance due to genotypic
variation. We also apply this to the community genetics context as the
variance in \textit{extended} phenotypic variance due to genotypic
variation \cite{DawkinsTheGene}. For the multivariate analyses, where
we employ PERMANOVA, we followed the methods of
\citep{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE} to adjust the degrees of freedom
for unbalanced genotype replicates.

Tree genotype influenced lichen network structure and multiple lichen
network metrics were heritable.  Tree genotype significantly predicted
the structural similarity of lichen networks (PERMANOVA:
Pseudo-$F_{9,27}$ = 3.58, $H^2$ = 0.41, \textit{p-value} = 0.0537)
(Fig.~\ref{fig:h2_plot}).  Overall network level metrics responded
significantly to tree genotype (Table~\ref{tab:h2_net}), including
network degree (\textit{RLRT} = 3.52, $H^2$ = 0.32, \textit{p-value} =
0.0255) and centralization including both in-coming and out-going
links (\textit{RLRT} = 4.04, $H^2$ = 0.33, \textit{p-value} = 0.0184)
or when separated into in-coming only (\textit{RLRT} = 3.9852, $H^2$ =
0.3309, \textit{p-value} = 0.0190) or out-going only (\textit{RLRT} =
3.8615, $H^2$ = 0.3193, \textit{p-value} = 0.0205).  Metrics including
only positive links also showed a significant effect of tree genotype,
including positive degree (\textit{RLRT} = 3.6925, $H^2$ = 0.3242,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0229), positive in-going centralization
(\textit{RLRT} = 4.4812, $H^2$ = 0.3487, \textit{p-value} = 0.0142)
Metrics calculated with negative links were not significant, including
degree (negative) (\textit{RLRT} = 0.0327, $H^2$ = 0.0318,
\textit{p-value} = 0.3859) and both in-coming (negative)
(\textit{RLRT} = 0.3304, $H^2$ = 0.1057, \textit{p-value} = 0.2508)
and out-going centralization (negative) (\textit{RLRT} = 0.0862, $H^2$
= 0.0513, \textit{p-value} = 0.3446).

The genetic response of network centralization was driven by variation
in \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa}. Centrality varied significantly among
species ($F_{8, 324}$ = 7.99, $R^2$ = 0.16, \textit{p-value} $<$
0.0001). \textit{Caloplaca holocarpa} centrality was the main species
to exhibit a significant response to tree genotype in terms of
positive centrality for both the in-coming (\textit{RLRT} = 3.61,
$H^2$ = 0.32, \textit{p-value} = 0.0240) and out-going (\textit{RLRT}
= 3.13, $H^2$ = 0.30, \textit{p-value} = 0.0327) perspectives, but not
for either negative centrality metrics in-coming (\textit{RLRT} = 0,
$H^2$ = 0, \textit{p-value} = 1) or out-going (\textit{RLRT} = 0,
$H^2$ = 0, \textit{p-value} = 0.4543). None of the other species'
centralities showed a genotypic response (Supplementary
Table~\ref{tab:sppcen}) with the exception of \textit{X. montana}
(\textit{RLRT} = 2.92, $H^2$ = 0.32, \textit{p-value} = 0.0375);
however, the centrality of \textit{X. montana} was much lower overall
relative to \textit{C. holocarpa} and the variation in
\textit{X. montana} centrality was restricted to two genotypes
(Fig.~\ref{fig:geno_sppcen}).

    holocarpa} centrality was highly variable among
  genotypes. \textit{Xanthomendoza montana} centrality, both in- and
  out-degree, was only non-zero for two genotypes, and only out-degree
  centrality displayed a significant response to genotype.}

\end{figure*}

\textit{Add transformations of variables to methods.}

Genotype indirectly influenced lichen network centralization via the
genetically based variation in bark roughness. The percent cover of
rough bark (\textit{RLRT} = 4.8526, $H^2$ = 0.3221, \textit{p-value} =
0.0113) and condensed tannins (\textit{RLRT} = 3.0522, $H^2$ = 0.3205,
\textit{p-value} = 0.0343) both displayed significant responses to
tree genotype. None of the other bark traits, pH (\textit{RLRT} =
0.00, $H^2$ = 0.00, \textit{p-value} = 1.0000) or carbon-nitrogen
ratio (\textit{RLRT} = 0.0000, $H^2$ = 0.0000, \textit{p-value} =
1.0000), showed a significant response to tree genotype and none other
than bark roughness was correlated with network similarity
(Table~\ref{tab:cn_trait_perm}); therefore, we focused our subsequent
analyses on the indirect effect of genotype on lichen network
structure via bark roughness. We found that bark roughness was
significantly correlated with network similarity (PERMANOVA:
Pseudo-$F_{1,32}$ = 13.029, $R^2$ = 0.26, \textit{p-value} = 0.0096)
and other lichen network metrics, including negative correlations with
overall network degree ($df$ = 35, $t$ = -2.13, $r$ = -0.34,
\textit{p-value} = 0.04) and centralization ($df$ = 35, $t$ = -2.52,
$r$ = -0.39, \textit{p-value} = 0.02). In other words, trees with more
similar levels of bark roughness tended to have lichen interaction
networks with similar structure. To quantify the genetic bases of this
effect of bark roughness on network structure, we used the residual
values from regressions of network degree and centralization in tests
of the effect of tree genotype and found no significant effect of tree
genotype for either degree (\textit{RLRT} = 0.00, $H^2$ = 0.00,
\textit{p-value} = 1.0000) or centralization (\textit{RLRT} = 0.00,
$H^2$ = 0.00, \textit{p-value} = 1.0000), suggesting that the observed
relationship between bark roughness and lichen network structure was
largely genetically based (Fig.~\ref{fig:br_net}).

\section*{Discussion}

We found that tree genotype influenced lichen network structure in the
experimental cottonwood forest. Network similarity and metrics of
network structure tended to be more similar on trees of the same
genotype. Generally, this genetic effect was manifested in positive
interactions and largely driven by \textit{C. holocarpa}. The
genetically based trait, bark roughness, was the only trait observed
to effect network variation, largely via shifts in positive in-coming
and out-going interactions. Bark roughness has been demonstrated
previously to be under strong genetic control \cite{Bdeir2017}, and
bark roughness has also previously been shown to be an important tree
trait influencing bark lichens \cite{Lamit2015a}; however this is the
first demonstration of a link from genes to lichen network structure.
As such these results have important implications for the potential
influence of genetically based variation in ecosystems with networks
of interacting species. This work is important because it provides a
mechanistic basis for understanding how community network theory is
intimately associated with the evolutionary process and how human
alterations of the environment (e.g., climate change, invasive
species, pollution) may have cascading, indirect effects that alter
network structure and evolution.


\subsection*{Implications of the Heritability of Interaction Network Structure}


We found significant heritability of lichen interaction network
structure, and, in line with the genetic similarity rule, networks
observed on trees of the same genotype tended to be structurally
similar. Although previous studies have examined aspects of networks,
such as trophic \cite{Barbour2019TraitCommunities} and forest
stand-level interaction network structure
\cite{Lau2016GenotypicEvolution, Keith2017}, this is the first study
that we are aware of to examine the heritability of network structure
with replicated networks at the genotype scale. Previous work in the
evolution of ecological networks have primarily focused on
macro-evolutionary dynamics \cite{Rezende2007,
  Weber2017EvolutionMacroevolution, Valverde2018TheSpandrel,
  Harmon2019DetectingInteractions} or have been simulation based
individual-level models that integrate intraspecific variation to the
species level \cite{Maliet2020AnNetworks}, even though recent
syntheses ave pointed to the importance of processes operating across
scales of organization \cite{Guimaraes2020TheOrganization}. There are
several important functional ramifications of genetically based
variation in network structure. First, intra-specific diversity could
be creating lichen interaction modules with different dynamics. When
communities are comprised of individuals whose habitat is primarily
the determined by another organism, these communities inherently form
modules within the larger ecosystem, as they tend to interact more
with each other than with other individuals \cite{Lau2017a}. Our study
demonstrates that the environmental differences determined by the
genetic variation within a single species can create differences that
not only impacts community composition, as repeatedly demonstrated in
other community genetics studies \cite{Whitham2006a,
  DesRoches2018TheVariation}, but also the structure of interactions
among individuals within these modules.  Some network structures are
likely to be more stable, either in response to disturbance or via
self-organized dynamics. For example, centralized networks, although
more efficient, are theorized to be more susceptible to targeted
attacks on the center of the network. For example, consider a forest
with two genotypes that support lichen communities that are similar in
total abundances of each species but differ in terms of the
structure. Extensions of game theory to evolutionary biology have
demonstrated that network structure can lead to variation in
evolutionary dynamics. Some structures tend toward dominance and
dampening of selection, while others lead to amplification of
selection. One class of networks that are theorized to have amplifying
effects on networks have "star" shapes with one or a few species at
the center and radiating interactions out from the central core
\cite{Lleberman2005EvolutionaryGraphs}. This is structurally what we
have observed with the networks that tend to occur on some of the
genotypes in our study, i.e. the more centralized networks. It is
possible that these more centralized networks could function as
hot-spots of evolutionary dynamics resulting from the amplifying
effect the network structure that is found on that tree genotype.


Second, even if the composition of the communities is the same among
individuals and genotypes, interactions may not be. We didn't observe
compositional differences using the same data from which the lichen
networks were derived. If we only had our composition dataset from
this study, we would have concluded no response of the lichen
community to tree genotype, even though the underlying interactions
among lichen species does vary among genotypes. As such differences in
network structure could occur without observable differences in
species richness or community composition, which have been the primary
focus of almost all previous community genetics studies
\cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}. Community composition of lichen has
previously been observed to be different among tree genotype in the
same experimental garden \cite{Lamit2011, Lamit2015a}, the difference
between the present study is likely a result of differences in
sampling method and the choice of genotypes leading to overall higher
abundances of observed lichens to assure the possibility of observing
xlichen interactions. The previous study also used a visual estimation
method, unlike the current study, which observed lichen at the scale
of 1 cm$^2$ cells, which could over-estimate cover depending on the
frequency at which actual thallus size was less than 1 cm$^2$, as well
as both the northern and southern aspects of each tree. These
differences do not negate the findings of either study. The present
study's finding of differences in network structure without
significant compositional differences points to the importance of
quantifying how network structure changes in response to genetic
variation in order to fully understand evolutionary dynamics in
complex communities. Having not observed a compositional effect of
tree genotyp without measuring the network structure could lead to the
conclusion of no genetic effect on the community, even though
important variation in network structure are leading to evolutionary
dynamics. It is possible that these underlying differences in
interactions among lichen could lead to differences in community
composition at a future point in time via there effects on species
abundances \cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE}; however, this is not
needed for evolutionary dynamics to play out via selection that leads
to shifts in trait distributions without shifting species abundance
distributions, which is possible under stabilizing, disruptive and
directional selection \cite{Conner2004ATextbook}. Thus, it is
imperative that further community genetics research assess or at least
be aware of the potential effects of variation in interactions and not
just observe species abundances.


\subsection*{Evolutionary Implications of a Genetic Basis to Network Structure}

A genetic basis to network structure suggests that some amount of
interaction network complexity is determined and therefore could be
predicted. Variation in space and time create variation in ecological
networks that influences evolutionary dynamics via shifts in
ecological dynamics, such as population demographics
\cite{Guimaraes2020TheOrganization}. Given that ecosystems are
comprised of hundreds and thousands of species, each having a
multitude of interactions, the potential to find traction for making
predictions in the context of ecological, let alone evolutionary,
dynamics seems daunting. The promise of predictability lies in the
presence of assymetries in ecosystems that contribute to the
occurrence of foundation species, such as hierarchy and nestedness
created by body size differences or life-history strategies, has been
widely observed \cite{Ellison2005}. The second part is that
heritability (i.e., genetic determination) means that there is
structure in the spatial or temporal variation that is created by
individuals of foundation species whose traits are in part determined
by underlying trait differences. Although this variation is inherently
a function of both genetics and environmental effects
\cite{Conner2004ATextbook}, the community and network level effects
are also a function of the scale of the interaction
\cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE}. Self-orgnization of the dynamics
within these communities also points to a mechanism for strong
community and ecosystem effects of genetic variation, contributing to
what may seem unlikely magnitudes of genetic effects as has been
observed in some systems, such as forest in riparian ecosystems
\cite{Bangert2006}.

Ecological network studies have focused on asymmetry and the
quantification of its structure in communities, with qualitative
discussion of the impacts on evolutionary dynamics
\cite{Bascompte2006, Diaz-Castelazo2010, Guimaraes2011,
  Thompson2013}. More specific predications, within a quantitative
framework, can be found in applications of evolutionary game theory,
and although developed at the population scale, such theory can apply
to communities. One seemingly useful direction from evolutionary
network developments from game theory is the classification of
networks into two general categories, rooted and cyclic, in which
rooted networks have interactions in which evolutionary effects
emanate from one or multiple origins but these effects do not have
connections back to the origins, whereas cyclic networks contain
feedbacks to one or more origins. Although it did not explicitly
define it in this context, the previous work of \citep{Lau2017a}
developed the perspective that the structure of the network in the
context of a foundation species, such as cottonwoods in which there
are demonstrable community level genetic effects, is inherently
created when trait variation among genotypes of a foundation species
has ecological effects on associated species.

This builds on many previous studies demonstrating that the community
level effects vary among multiple genotypes. It is not clear what
potential there is for feedbacks there are to the origins (e.g. the
cottonwood genotypes) from the community, and as such it cannot be
determined whether these networks are cyclic or rooted. In terrestrial
ecosystems, lichen play important ecological roles, such as substrate
stabilization \cite{Root2011BioticWashington} and nutrient fixation
\cite{Nelson2018LichenHelens}. In some systems lignicolous lichens can
have demonstrable effects on the availability of nutrients for the
trees that they are associated with \cite{Norby1989NitrogenDioxide},
although this has not been measured for the lichen in the current
study's systemq. Elucidating the absence and/or presence of and
quantifying such feedbacks would allow for the determination of the
cyclic nature and potential evolutionary dynamics of this system. The
presence of feedbacks would provide the potential for non-linear
dynamics in which evolutionary effects are dampened or amplified by
the structure of the network. For example, a star structure in which
there is a primary or core set of central species with feedbacks from
the radiating species has been demonstrated to be a structure that
amplifies evolutionary dynamics
\cite{Lieberman2005EvolutionaryGraphs}. If such feedbacks do not
exist, these sub-networks of the lichen and tree genotypes are
likely to be multi-rooted networks. Such a structure is theorized to
generally promote diversification as variation arising from the
shifting distribution of the ``roots'', i.e. genotypes; however, loss
of genotype/root diversity could lead to fixation of a single genotype
in the population and a decrease in community-wide diversity. However,
such feedbacks to tree fitness are not necessary for evolutionary
dynamics to play out within the lichen networks through the effects of
altered network structure on lichen interaction outcomes, such as
competitive exclusion leading to selection.

Since lichen are multi-species complexes, there is also the potential
for evolutionary dynamics to shift within the context of the lichen
symbiosis. There is substantial evidence that lichen have served as
the ``cradle of symbiotrophic fungal diversification''
\cite{Arnold2009ADiversification} and recent research has shown
significant network structure of endolichenic fungi and lichen
collected from across North America
\cite{Chagnon2016InteractionScale}. Analysis of the structure of
ecological networks has generally supported the conclusion that
nestedness, or the degree to which species tend to interact with
similar subsets of the community, tends to promote stability in
mutualistic, primarily bipartite (i.e., two-mode), networks and
modularity contributes to the stabilization of antagonistic networks
\cite{Elias2013EvolutionaryNetwork,
  Grilli2016ModularityCommunities}. Although there is growing evidence
that the nestedness of mutualistic networks is not necessarily the
result of selection for systems-level properties that promote
stability but could be either product of asymptotic abundance
distributions leading to un-even interaction frequencies
\cite{Staniczenko2013TheNetworks} and/or a by-product of selection and
divergence creating network ``spandrels'' in ecosystems
\cite{Valverde2018TheSpandrel}, this does not preclude the functional
consequences of network structure but rather the developmental or
evolutionary processes that have produced the structure. In the
present study, we did not examine nestedness or modularity of the
lichen networks as we could not find metrics for analyzing networks
that are not only weighted and directed but also signed. Hopefully
future network theoretic developments will make the appropriate
metrics available to conduct these analyses.

\subsection*{Implications for Interspecific Indirect Genetic Effects (IIGEs)}

Interspecific indirect genetic effects (IIGE) theory provides a
quantitative framework within which to approach evolutionary theory at
higher levels of biological organization: from populations to
communities and ecosystems. To date, this theory has focused on
modeling the strong effects of foundation species
\cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE, Whitham2012}, but it has not yet
integrated developments in the ecological or evolutionary network
theory literature. This is to say that it has not developed a way to
examine complex interactions among species; however, previous studies
have demonstrated this network context is likely to be important, as
altering the structure of interaction networks provides a means for
genetic effects to be dampened or magnified within the system of
interacting species. For example, \citep{Keith2017} showed that the
genetics based interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible
trees resulted in different interaction networks of their associated
arthropod communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of
ecosystems, trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates
of energy and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype. Also, work by \citep{Toju2017, Toju2016, Toju2014a} observed
consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species modules
focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other words, a
small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and likely
are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure and
dynamics.

The results of the current study provides clear empirical evidence
that variation in network structure can be genetically based
(i.e. heritable) and points to the need to expand IIGEs encompass the
structure of interaction networks. Although such a synthesis
necessitates a much greater effort than can be afforded in this paper,
it is possible to point to several productive pathways forward. In
terms of interaction networks, foundation species are relatively
central within the system of interactions, that is their direct and/or
indirect effects are greater then other species. So, when the more
centralized (foundation) species have genetically based interactions,
genetic effects will tend to be magnified in the community. Here, we
found that even though more abundant or more centralized
(i.e. ``important'') species were present in the community, their
effects were not the main component responding to genetic
effects. Considering the impact of network structure would be a
productive path forward for the theoretical development and
application of the IIGE concept. These results also provide insights
into the dynamics of real ecosystems and the potential inter-play of
ecology and evolution with regard to empirical and theoretical support
for neutral theory, as models have been developed that can reconstruct
interactions networks with similar structural characteristics to those
observed in real ecosystems \cite{Coelho2018NeutralInteractions}. The
findings or our study support the possibility that, although
communities and their interaction networks may assemble as a result of
conditions that are entirely agnostic to functional variation, if
there are strong ecological assymetries, such as the case in
foundation species systems, then spatial and temporal variation in
network structure will arise as a results of trait variation within
the foundtion species. Taking even the extreme case, even when such
genetically based variation is the result of ``neutral'' evolutionary
processes (e.g., genetic drift), as long as resulting genetic
diversity produces ecological relevant phenotypic diversity, then
network structure will still have a genetic basis. Given that
ecosystems with large assymetries seem to be the rule rather than the
excpetion for ecosystems \cite{Ellison2005,
  Santamaria2007LinkageBarriers, Staniczenko2013TheNetworks,
  Dormann2017IdentifyingLimitations, Coelho2018NeutralInteractions},
the results of our study are likely to be broadly applicable and
provides further support for the conclusion that the community context
of evolutionary dynamics at either micro- or macro-evolutionary scales
\cite{Weber2017EvolutionMacroevolution, Harmon2019DetectingInteractions} cannot safely be
ignored. As genetic variation is inherent to biological systems, it
would now seem that the adage ``you can't be neutral on a moving
train'' might well apply to ecosystems that are comprised of
interacting species.


\subsection*{Applicability to Other Systems}


In attempting to apply these findings to other systems, it is
important to consider the spatial and temporal scaling of genetic
effects. In the present study, the sessile nature of lichens means
that individuals, and potentially multiple generations, live their
entire lives on a single tree. As such, our study examines one scaling
of a genetic effect, in which the phenotype of a single tree
individual (i.e., tree genotype) has complete influence on the
community with little to no effect of other tree individuals in the
population. The extreme from this would be where the associated
community moved among and interacted with not only other community
members but also multiple tree individuals at a high rate, as would be
the case with free-living animals (e.g. flying insects). In the latter
case, the effect of tree genetics would then be the integral effect of
all the tree individuals in the population, and, all other factors
being equal, any one tree genotype would have a lower effect on
associated community. In reality, ecosystems are a mixture of species
of different body sizes and life-histories, and, as such, vary in the
degree to which they interact with other organisms, which is the basis
of the theory of the geographic mosaic of co-evolution
\cite{Thompson2013, Thompson2013a}. It is now important to consider
how the impacts of genetic effects on the network structure of
sub-groups, such as lichens, may or may not propagate through the
ecosystem to more mobile organisms. As developed previously, the
degree to which a genetic effect influences the community is a
function of the fidelity of the genetic effect (i.e., heritability)
and both the frequency and the intensity of the interaction
\cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE}. One possible path forward is for
future work to extend the many previous community genetics studies
that have focused on sessile organisms, such as galling insects
\cite{Bailey2005ImportanceInteractions, Whitham2006a, Crutsinger2014,
  Smith2011, Keith2017}, to quantify the frequency of these
interactions in the context of the larger community. This would
provide an estimate of the relative impact of these focal, often
termed foundation, species. In addition, community genetics theory has
only considered first order interactions, i.e., between two organisms
\cite{Shuster2006COMMUNITYSTRUCTURE, Whitham2012,
  Whitham2020IntraspecificEvolution}. Given that network structure
could be influenced by genetic effects, as evidenced by the present
study, assessing higher order interactions could provide a path
forward for theoretical advances that could help with identifying
important characteristics of sub-groups to focus on in empirical
studies.

Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results can be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms around
the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}. However, there are
important points to consider when extending the observed genetically
based response of the lichen networks to other systems. As bark lichen
individuals do not move, but grow in a primarily two dimensional
plane, these communities and their interactions occur in the highly
localized context of the tree's bark surface. Lichen individuals are
also many orders of magnitude smaller than the tree individual in this
system \cite{Lamit2011}. For these reasons, the genetic effects on
these communities is not dampened by the movement of individuals and
the mixing of the effect of different tree genotypes on the lichen
community, as might occur for more mobile species (e.g. insects and
birds). Relatedly, we only examined lichen in this study, and other
species whose distributions, abundances and/or interactions vary in
their response to tree genotype, such as animals that may also impact
lichen communities, could be playing a role that we did not
examine. For example, an analysis of the multivariate correlations of
different components of the community in this system demonstrated
significant patterns of genetic co-responses to tree genotype,
supporting the non-mutually exclusive possibilities of shared
responses to tree genotype or tree genotypic effects on interactions
among these sub-communities \cite{Lamit2015c}. As such, although we
can not rule out the possibility that other unmeasured tree traits or
organisms correlated with bark roughness are underlying the observed
patterns, substantial research supports the importance of genetically
based tree traits for communities and ecosystems
\cite{DesRoches2018TheVariation}, and in particular bark roughness for
bark lichen communities \cite{Bdeir2017, Lamit2011, Lamit2015a}.

\subsection*{Conclusion}

In the face of the high degree of complexity and potential context
dependency of ecological processes, the current study points to the
utility of considering the spatial and temporal scales of
interactions, as discussed to some in previous studies
\cite{Bangert2006, Zook2010, Zytynska2012}. In the present study, we
found that community assembly processes, such as environmental
filtering and species interactions, are genetically based. This is
likely due, in part, to the large difference in the differences in
size and longevity of the lichen and cottonwood individuals with the
trees determining the environment in which the lichen occur. The
importance of the scale of network organization to create hierarchical
structure \cite{Guimaraes2020TheOrganization} and the potential for
foundation species to create this structure in the vast majority of
ecosystems \cite{Ellison2005, Whitham2006a} suggests that future work
would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with similar differences in body-size
and time-scales. Also, as heritable variation is the raw material for
natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}. Such findings will bring us closer to understanding
the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank and the
interconnectedness of species in complex communities.

%% \textbf{LJL: I agree that there is a general overarching theme that
%%   evolution occurs in a community network context, but I’m not sure
%%   that we should state that as our main hypothesis. It seems more that
%%   this is a fundamental foundation for our work. The hypothesis is
%%   more what we are testing directly, but we don’t test this
%%   directly. I guess I don’t want to give the impresison that our
%%   communities are necessarily the result of each species evolving into
%%   its place in the community on these tree genotypes (although I do
%%   understand this as Shuster et al 2006’s fundamental explanation for
%%   why we see different communities on different genotypes; I don’t
%%   necessarily agree that this is the only reason we woudl see
%%   different communities on dif genotypes). Most of these are pretty
%%   generalist lichens, which could be found on other decidous trees in
%%   the surounding city or natural areas. I would look at it more like
%%   an assembling of lichen species into unique configurations on
%%   genetically different substrates. There may be some selection for
%%   different genotype of lichen during the community assembly process
%%   but we can’t really tell that just by differences in species
%%   abundances or coocurneces. I guess to me the evolutionary context
%%   that is more direclty related to this work is that the tree genotype
%%   is a central controller (indeed a sort of hub species in the
%%   network) of network structure. By anchoring the lichen network to
%%   tree genotype (and variation among networks to variation among tree
%%   genotypes) , our study highlights the possibility that natural
%%   selection acting on the trees may have an extended consequence for
%%   the network structure of organisms living on the trees…the extra
%%   thing we add to the field is that we show interaction networks are
%%   sensitive to genotype. I doubt the lichens have a direct effect on
%%   tree fitness, but favorability of some tree genotypes over others
%%   during natural selection will then go on to favor and disfavor
%%   certain lichen communities of different network structures. By being
%%   sensitive to tree genotype, the lichen community networks are
%%   passive riders on the waves of evolutionary dynamics that occur
%%   within the tree species they inhabit.}

%% \textbf{TGW: might be good to \cite papers on competition in lichens or
%%   other organizing factors to back up the least expected statement.
%%   as epiphytes we might not expect them to care.}

%% \textbf{TGW: I think we need to emphasize the long-term nature of our
%%   common garden study as very few common garden studies of lichens
%%   likely exist. Any refs on this? If true might want to mention this
%%   up front in intro.}

%% \textbf{MKL: Environmental filtering is evidenced by species richness,
%%   but also possibly species interaction varying based on environment
%%   as networks varied in terms of sign and magnitude as well.}
