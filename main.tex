Biological evolution occurs in the context of complex networks of
interacting species in which natural selection defines the structure
of ecological networks. Fundamental to this evolutionary process is
the discovery of a genetic basis to ecological network
structure. Although previous work has demonstrated that tree genotype
contributes to interaction network structure at the scale of forest
stands, the contribution of tree genetics to localized interaction
networks at the scale of individual trees has not yet been
explored. To test the degree to which tree genetics can contribute to
network structure we conducted quantitative modeling of interaction
networks. We constructed networks of epiphytic lichen associated with
individual trees that were a part of a long-term experimental common
garden of genotypes of a foundation species (\textit{Populus
  angustifolia}). We found three main results: 1) bark roughness and
lichen communities displayed signficant responses to tree genotype, 2)
tree genotype contributed to lichen network structure, explaining a
third of the variation in lichen interaction networks, and 3)
different aspects of lichen network structure, including the number of
interactions and centralization, responded to tree genotype, primarily
as a function of the number of species present and to a lesser extent
the abundance of lichen. We conclude that tree genotype influences
lichen interaction network structure with one potential pathway being
that bark roughness alters the presence and overall abundance of
lichen, which determines the nature and magnitude of interactions in
the community. These results support the hypothesis that variation in
ecological interaction networks can result from genetically based
variation in foundation species. This study opens the possibility for
a genetic basis to both direct and indirect interactions among species
in complex communities.

%% Introduction

\dropcap{E}volution occurs in the context of complex ecological
networks. Initially, evolution in a community context was focused on
examples of highly co-evolved pairs of species (e.g. Darwin's famous
prediction of the Sphinx Moth and Christmas Orchid)
\cite{Wade2007}. However, studies of diffuse co-evolution
(\textit{sensu} \cite{Janzen1980}) \cite{Stinchcombe2002, Strauss2007,
  Dicke2010}, geographic mosaics of co-evolution \cite{Thompson2005}
and community genetics \cite{Whitham2006} have provided an in-road for
ecological network approaches \cite{Fortuna2009, Keith2017, Lau2016}
to illuminate a more complex perspective of the interface between
ecological and evolutionary dynamics. There is now evidence to suport
that selection tends to occur among groups of species \cite{Wade2007,
  Pieterse2007, Dicke2010} favoring the development of small webs
\cite{Nuismer2006, Guimaraes2007, Gomez2009} and that genetic
variation and phylogenetic relatedness contributes to variation in
community assembly \cite{Crutsinger2016} and species interactions
\cite{Whitham2006a, Bailey2009, Moya-Larano2011}, which shapes the
ecological interaction networks \cite{Rezende2007}.

\textbf{LJL: I think a key point in the first paragraph is to point
  out that networks are believe in part to emerge out of complex
  evolutionary interactions. But, to-date, the patterns observed in
  networks are primarily only on the scale of species interactions and
  phylogenetic signature. There has yet to be much work connecting
  ecological species networks at the scale relevant to the actual
  workings of microevolutionary processes (e.g., the genotype or
  population level).}


Community genetics studies \cite{Lamit2015a} have shown that
genetic variation in foundation species \cite{Ellison2005} plays a
significant role in defining distinct communities of interacting
organisms:  such as, endophytes, pathogens, lichens, arthropods, and
soil microbes. Multiple studies have now demonstrated that genetic
variation influences numerous functional traits (e.g., phytochemical,
phenological, morphological) produces a multivariate phenotype
\cite{holeski2012} that contributes to variation in associated
communities \cite{Bailey2009a}.

\textbf{LJL: I think the thing that needs to emerge in this paragraph
  is that even though there is some incling that genotype is relevant
  in community networks, as based on our few past studies, no study
  has truely examined networks on individual trees.}


Additional work has provided support for the hypothesis that not only
does composition vary among genetically distinct genotypes of
foundation species, it also impacts the structure of the network of
species interactions in these communities \cite{Keith2017,
  Lau2015a}. Also, work by \citep{Toju2017, Toju2016, Toju2014a}
observed consistent patterns of centralized interactions of species
modules focused around hubs of plant-fungal interactions. In other
words, a small number of plant and fungal symbionts tended to have
have disproportionate numbers of interactions with other species and
likely are the drivers in determining community assembly, structure
and dynamics.

\textbf{You mention the naturally established stand but then that data
  doesn’t get included in the manuscript. I do like the idea of
  including the field data. We might need to cross reference IDs of
  the lichens in my community composition data on the same trees since
  there was considerably more diversity than we initially saw out
  there. We would just want to make sure the same names are applied to
  taxa in the same quatrats on each tree. It probably wouldn’t take
  long.}

\textbf{LJL: If I recall, the Elamo paper just looks at genetic
  correlations between pairwise individual abundances. I would suggest
  maybe it doesn’t deserve to be in this 1st paragraph. Perhaps it
  actually should be in the 2nd or 3rd paragraph, just as a reference
  that points to the potential for genotype to influence
  networks. Definately our 2015 JOE paper goes much further, too,
  since it has whole communities being correlationed. But, again, I
  woudl put both of these as citation in the community genetics
  paragraphs (2 of 3) instead of the first paragrpah, which focuses on
  the general network lit.}


Here, we investigate how genetic variation in a foundation tree
species determines the structure of a network of interactions among a
community of tree associated lichen species. Using a long-term (20+
years), common garden experiment with replicated individuals of known
genetic identity and a naturally established stand of \textit{Populus
  angustifolia}. We focused on a model community of 9 epiphytic
lichens species, as previous research has demonstrated significant
compositional responses of epiphytes to genotypic variation
\cite{Winfree2011, Zytynska2011}. In addition, the life-history
characteristics of lichen, having highly localized, direct contact
interactions and slow population turnover rates, allowed us to assess
interactions among lichen species on individual trees. We hypothesize
that in natural systems evolution occurs in a community context
involving interactions of complex networks of interacting species
\cite{Lau2015a, Keith2017, Thompson2013, Bascompte2006}.  If correct,
we should expect to find that network structure is genetically based
in which different plant genotypes support different interaction
networks and that these interactions networks can function as
indicators of ecological dynamics important for conserving
biodiversity.  Applying a probability-theory based network modeling
approach, we constructed a set of interaction network models for the
lichen associated with individual trees. Using these models, we then
examined the genetic basis of the structure of these ecological
networks.


\textbf{LJL: 
I agree that there is a general overarching theme that evolution
occurs in a community network context, but I’m not sure that we should
state that as our main hypothesis. It seems more that this is a
fundamental foundation for our work. The hypothesis is more what we
are testing directly, but we don’t test this directly.

I guess I don’t want to give the impresison that our communities are
necessarily the result of each species evolving into its place in the
community on these tree genotypes (although I do understand this as
Shuster et al 2006’s fundamental explanation for why we see different
communities on different genotypes; I don’t necessarily agree that
this is the only reason we woudl see different communities on dif
genotypes). Most of these are pretty generalist lichens, which could
be found on other decidous trees in the surounding city or natural
areas. I would look at it more like an assembling of lichen species
into unique configurations on genetically different substrates. There
may be some selection for different genotype of lichen during the
community assembly process but we can’t really tell that just by
differences in species abundances or coocurneces.

I guess to me the evolutionary context that is more direclty related
to this work is that the tree genotype is a central controller (indeed
a sort of hub species in the network) of network structure. By
anchoring the lichen network to tree genotype (and variation among
networks to variation among tree genotypes) , our study highlights the
possibility that natural selection acting on the trees may have an
extended consequence for the network structure of organisms living on
the trees…the extra thing we add to the field is that we show
interaction networks are sensitive to genotype. I doubt the lichens
have a direct effect on tree fitness, but favorability of some tree
genotypes over others during natural selection will then go on to
favor and disfavor certain lichen communities of different network
structures. By being sensitive to tree genotype, the lichen community
networks are passive riders on the waves of evolutionary dynamics that
occur within the tree species they inhabit.}

\textbf{MKL: In response to Lamit's comment above, I agree that it is
  not reuqired that there is co-evolution. Another, perhaps simpler,
  explanation is that there is variation in environmental filtering of
  lichen individuals created in part by genetic variation in tree
  individuals.}

\matmethods{


The study was conducted along the Weber River, UT (USA), which is a
cottonwood (\textit{Populus} spp.) dominated riparian
ecosystem. Although two native species, \textit{Populus angustifolia}
(James) and \textit{Populus fremontii} (S. Watson), occur here and are
known to hybridize, only pure or advanced generation backcrosses of
\textit{P. angustifolia} were sampled in order to avoid the effect of
the hybridization between these two species \cite{Zinkgraf2016}. Bark
lichen have been extensively study in this system previously, and
provide an ideal system in which to observe and model lichen
interaction networks, as their sessile nature permits accurate
identification of individuals \cite{Lamit2011}.

\textbf{MKL: Need to add more citations of Lamits or other lichen
  studies.}

\textbf{LJL: If you include the field data, I would suggest changing
  the topic sentence for this paragraph and adding something about the
  field data sampling to this paragrpah. Note, also that we cored and
  aged each field tree so we can site the age range of the trees here,
  to make it clear they are within those of the garden.}

A long-term, common garden experiment was used to isolate the effect
of tree genotype from the effect of the localized microenvironment
associated with each individual and spatial
autocorrelation. Established in 1992, asexually propagated clones of
genotyped \textit{P. angustifolia} individuals were obtained from wild
collections and planted in fully randomized design at the Ogden Nature
Center, Ogden, UT. From the population of established individuals in
the common garden, we chose a total of thirteen genotypes, replicated
between 3 and 8 times each, for sampling.


\subsection*{Bark Lichen Observations}

\textbf{LJL: The topic sentence here makes it seem like only one
  quadrat grid was sampled. Maybe do not include the grid size here
  but instead just make a general statement of the sampling in a
  checkerboard in two quadrats, then go on to explain in detail.}

\textbf{LJL: A total pain in the butt but it might be good just to
  double check that our exact species that occured in each quadrat are
  the same as the species that I found in the composition data. No
  doubt that I woudl have foudn more species but it might be a good
  double check of things just to see if they roughly correspond. I can
  do this if you send me your matrix.}

\textbf{LJL: I think this sentence is good and these lichens tend to
  be ones that were rarer or really easy to miss. So, the list of
  species you picked up sounds logit to me. One thing… above you say
  14 species but only 9 were found. That is a bit redundant with this
  next sentence that highlights which species were found and which
  were not obsered. I would just stick with the second sentence and
  delete the first sentence.}

On each tree, presence or absence of each lichen species was assessed
in 50 total 1 cm$^2$ cells arrayed in a checkerboard pattern. Given
the small size and sessile nature of lichen, we were able to rapidly
assess lichen interactions by quantifying thalli in close
contact. Sampling was restricted to the northern aspect of the trunk
to maximize the abundance of lichen and control for the effect of
trunk aspect. Two adjacent 10 cm$^2$ quadrats centered at 50 cm and 85
cm from ground level were sampled (Fig~\ref{fig:lichen_sampling} A and
B). The observed lichen community included (abbreviations are given
for species present in study): Xg = \textit{Xanthomendoza
  galericulata}, Xm = \textit{X. montana}, Ch = \textit{Caloplaca
  holocarpa}, Cs = \textit{Candelariella subdeflexa}, Rg =
\textit{Rinodina glauca}, Lh = \textit{Lecanora hagenii}, Pm =
\textit{Phyciella melanchra}, Pa = \textit{Physcia adscendens}, Pu =
\textit{Physcia undulata}. Several other species were not obesrved in
the present study but are known to occur in this region:
\textit{Phaeophyscia orbicularis}, \textit{Phaeophyscia ciliata},
\textit{Melanelia subolivacea}, \textit{Meanelia elegantula}.


The cell size and checkerboard sampling pattern was chosen to isolate
the individuals in each cell. In a previous survey of lichen thallus
size in this common garden, we had observed a median thallus size of
0.12 $\pm$ 0.001 cm$^2$ (S.E.) (see Supplementary
Fig~\ref{fig:SI_xg_median}). Based on this, we expected thalli
observed in each cell to generally be spatially independent of the
other cells in the quadrat but exposed to similar micro-environmental
conditions created by the bark and the location of the sampling area
on an individual tree. Therefore, we were confident in treating the
cell-wise observations in quadrats as independent with respect to
lichen-lichen interactions.

\textbf{LJL: My method was overal visual \% cover. I didn’t count P/A
  of rough bark in each square. So, yo might just want to site our
  Ecology lichen paper as showing rough bark is important, but not
  cite it as the same method. No doubt the methods should yeild
  similar results but the approach is slightly different.}


As bark roughness had previously been shown to be an important,
genetically based tree trait impacting bark lichen, we measured the
percentage of rough bark on each tree following the methods of
\citep{Lamit2011}. Briefly, the number of cells containing disrupted,
fissured bark were counted within each quadrat on each tree. The
number of rough bark containing cells were then summed and divided by
the total number of cells surveyed. This was done for all quadrats on
all trees in which lichen communities were also observed.

\subsection*{Lichen Network Modeling and Analysis}

\textbf{LJL: This seems like a key point, one that really makes the
  study above and beyond.  I would make it clear with the phrasing
  that individual networks were created for each individual tree
  sampled, in this way we had replicated networks for each tree
  genotypes.}

We used the observations of lichen in the 1 cm$^2$ cells on individual
trees of \textit{P. angustifolia}. Unipartite networks were generated
using the conditional probabilities of each species pair, i.e. the
probability of observing one species given an observation of another
species $P(S_i | S_j)$, based on the method developed by
\citep{Araujo2011}. To calculate conditional probabilities, we
quantified the individual probabilities of species occurrences
$P(S_i)$ and the joint probability of co-occurrences $P(S_i,S_j)$
using the frequencies of each species and their co-occurrences. We
were then able to calculate the conditional probabilities of each
species pair as $P(S_i|S_j) = \frac{P(S_i,S_j)}{P(S_j)}$, based on the
axioms of probability. This yielded a matrix that could possibly be
asymetric, i.e. $P(S_i|S_j)$ does not have to be equal to
$P(S_j|S_i)$. Another important property of this matrix is that the
diagonal ($S_{ii}$) was equal to one for all species present and zero
for species that were not observed in any cell.

\textbf{MKL: regarding Lamit's question about the symmetry, the point
  is that direction of the interaction matters. The effect of species
  A on B can be different from B on A. No the matrix is not
  necessarily triangular (triangular being that the matrix either
  above or below the diagonal is completely zero).}

We then applied an analytical procedure to remove non-significant
links between species. This procedure determines if the joint
probability of a species pair (i.e. $P(S_i,S_j)$) is different from
zero (Fig.~\ref{fig:conet_method}).  Here, a confidence interval
$CI_{95\%}$ is calculated as as $CI_{95\%} = E[S_iS_j] * Z_{95\%} *
\sqrt{V(S_iS_j)}$, where the expected frequency of co-occurrences
E($S_iS_j$) is the total number of cells surveyed ($N$) times the
independent probabilities of each species $P(S_i) * P(S_j)$,
$Z_{95\%}$ is the Z-score for 95\% from a Z-distribution and the
expected variance of $E(S_iS_j)$ is the total number of cells times
the expected probability of $S_iS_j$ and its compliment
(i.e. $V(S_iS_j) = N * E[P(S_i,S_j)] * (1 - E[P(S_i,S_j)])$). If the
observed number of co-occurrence falls outside of the confidence
interval, the joint probability $P(S_i,S_j)$ is determined to be equal
to the product of the individual probabilities (i.e. $P(S_i) \dot
P(S_j)$), and the conditional probability reduces to the individual
probability of that species $P(S_i)$. Therefore, unless the
co-occurrence of a species pair falls outside the confidence interval,
the probability that the observation of one species given the other is
no different than simply observing that species alone. This enables us
to remove links from a given network by re-scaling the resulting
conditional probabilities by subtracting the individual probabilities
from the conditional probabilities (i.e. how different the conditional
probability is from the independent probability), which makes any
species with a non-significant conditional probability zero. The
resulting matrix ($\mathbf{D} = D_{ij}$) can be interpreted as how one
species impacts another with zero being no effect and values less than
or greater than zero interpreted as negative and positive effects,
respectively. Here, we will refer to this matrix ($\mathbf{D}$) as an
interaction matrix with the properties that it can be asymetric
(i.e. $P_{ij}$ does not necessarily equal $P_{ji}$), and the diagonal
($P_{ii}$) is zero (i.e. a species does not influence it's own
probability of being observed).

\textbf{LJL: This approach seems legit and it sound
  impressive. However, I admit that I think it is a bit above my head
  and possibly Tom’s, too. I have no doubt you did everything
  correct. But, it might be wise to get a friendly review from a mathy
  person just to be on the safe side. Perhaps Stuart in NC, or Aaron
  Ellison.} 

\textbf{MKL: agreed. This seems like a job for Bowker or Stuart. They
  can take a look on the next round of reviews.}

  total cell observations were recorded for each tree with the
  presence or absence of each species recorded for each cell. Applying
  the probability-based network modeling method adapted from
  \cite{Araujo2011}, we calculated the conditional probabilities,
  $P(S_i|S_j)$, for all species pairs and removed (i.e. set equal to
  zero) species pairs whose joint probabilities, $P(S_i S_j)$, were
  not significant using a confidence interval based comparison of
  their observed co-occurrence frequency, $S_iS_j$, to that expected
  due to chance alone, $E[P(S_iS_j)] = P(S_i) P(S_j)$, and
  $P(S_i|S_j)$ reduces to $P(S_i)$, the observed individual

\textbf{LJL: I like the details here. THe one thing is that it sort of
  makes the reader think there is only one quadrat on a tree but
  infact there were two. I think you want to make sure to be explicit
  about the two. For analytical purposes, was all the data lumped so
  there was really functionally a 20cm by 10cm grid (just split into
  two pieces). Or, was the network made for each of the two grids and
  them averaged or combined in some way? My understanding is that it
  was more the first than the latter.}

\textbf{MKL: Yeah, it was the latter. I'm using two quadrats lumped
  together. I'll add more text here to clarify that.}


\subsection*{Statistical Analyses, Software and Data}

We used a combination of parametric and non-parametric, permutation
based frequentist statistical analyses to test for the effects of
genetic variation on lichen communities and their interaction
networks. To assess the effect of genotype on univariate responses, we
used additive, random effects models with Restricted Maximum
Likelihood (REML). We used a combination of Least Squares Regression,
Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and correlation tests to quantify and
test for the relationship among other variables. Bark roughness,
lichen cover and species richness were square-root transformed to meet
the assumptions of homogeneity of variance and normality for these
tests.

\textbf{LJL: Was data for the networks relativized, too?  THis
  paragraph seems to merge what was done with the networks and what
  was done to test basic composition with relative abundances. I think
  it would be important for clarity sake to seperate them into two
  paragraphs. Have one about testing composition and one for testing
  networks. Along those lines, you can mere the NMDS stuf below into
  each of these paragrpahs were relavant. Keeping them seperate would
  make it clearer to the reader.}

For multivariate response variables, such as lichen community
composition and network structure, we used distance based multivariate
statistical approaches, including Permutational Analysis of Variance
(PerMANOVA) and Mantel tests. For all analyses, community composition
was relativized by species maxima to reduce the effect of the highly
abundant \textit{X. galericulata}. For community composition we used
Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, which has optimal performance with count
data \citep{Minchen1998}. To quantify the similarity of lichen
networks among individual trees, we calculated the pairwise Euclidean
distance of the $\mathbf{D}$ interaction matrices among all pairs of
trees.

For visualization of multivariate patterns, we used Non-metric
Multi-Dimensional Scaling (NMDS) \cite{ecodist} to produce
dimensionally reduced ordinations of these multi-variate responses and
fitted vectors for continuous predictor variables to the ordinated
values \cite{vegan}. Using random initial configurations with a
maximum of 500 iterations and a change in stress threshold of less
than 10$^{-12}$. Final configurations has the lowest stress with at
most a stress level of 0.10.


For each network, we also calculated two network metrics that measure
different structural aspects. We calculated the number of interactions
or ``links'' in each network, which provides a measure of the size of
the network \citep{Lau2015, Borrett2015}. We also calculated the
centralization of each network, which measures the evenness of the
distribution of interactions among the species in the network
\cite{Butts2005}. In a network with a low level of centralization
species have similar amount of interaction in the network, while a
network with a high level of centralization tends to one or small
subset of species that interact with other species. We used a related
function to calculate the centrality of each species in each network
as well. Although there are many other metrics, see \citep{Lau2017a},
we focus on a subset for the sake of simplicity and because some
metrics are not appropriate for our relatively small
communities. \textbf{In particular, we do not present analysis of the
  modularity (i.e. the degree of sub-grouping) because our community
  has relatively few species to form modules.} As with the other
response variables, the number of links was log-transformed and
centralization scores were square-root transformed to meet variance
and normality assumptions.

\textbf{LJL: I suggest deleting the highlighted part. And, just
  changing the sentence above it to “...because some metric (e.g.,
  modularity) are not appropriate...”  Too much emphasis on caviots
  will make some readers be uncertain. But, also, you can save some
  space that way.}

We have made all code and data available online. Code is available at
\url{github.com/communitygenetics/lcn}. Data is available via the
Harvard Dataverse (needs project ID). The project is also archived via
Zenodo at \url{zenodo.com/doiXXXXXX}. All analyses were conducted
using the programming language R version 3.4.2 (R Development Core
Team 2018).

\end{figure}

\textbf{LJL: Figure looks good. But, maybe making all lines a little
  thicker would look nicer and pop more.}

\textbf{LJL: Since we already published that tree genotypes differ in
  lichen composition, I wonder if we need to say somewhere in the
  manuscript why this test was run here. It seems to me it is
  important to verify this with a slightly different sampling method
  as used int eh 2015 paper, and for this specific set of
  genotypes. But, then does this test of composition just become
  something necessary just in a methodological variation that
  justifies the next step of examing network structure.  Something to
  think about. It might be that theNMDS should jsut go in a
  supplement, although I do like it here in some ways.  It might also
  be another approach to put the composition and other analyses after
  the network analysis results are presented. In this way, you could
  use the composition and results with vectors to help provide
  resolution on what is driving networks to differ among genotypes.}


\textbf{MKL: Adapt into a table.}

Bark roughness and lichen communities responded to tree
genotype. Percent rough bark varied significantly among genotypes
(REML $R^2$ = 0.378, RLRT = 10.69, $p$-value = 0.0001), as did total
lichen cover (REML $R^2$ = 0.172, RLRT = 2.9627, $p$-value =
0.0375).However, lichen species richness did not show a significant
response to genotype (REML $R^2$ = 0.0981, RLRT = 1.0001, $p$-value =
0.1366). Community composition was also affected by tree genotype
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.243, F 12 = 1.8221, $p$-value = 0.0029). In
addition, community composition was correlated with bark roughness
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.039, $F_1$ = 3.7408, $p$-value = 0.0064), lichen
cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.342, $F_1$ = 32.8482, $p$-value = 0.0001)
and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.069, $F_1$ = 6.5958,
$p$-value = 0.0002) (Fig.~\ref{fig:com_ch_plot}). However, after
controlling for the effect of tree genotype on community composition,
bark roughness did not significantly predict community composition
(PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.011, F 1 = 0.9938, $p$-value = 0.3841) but lichen
cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.236, $F_1$ = 21.2661, $p$-value = 0.0001)
and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.054, $F_1$ = 4.9036,
$p$-value = 0.0011) were still significantly correlated with lichen
composition (Supplementary Tables~\ref{tab:com_ng_perm} and
~\ref{tab:rcom_perm}).


\begin{figure}[ht]

\label{fig:geno_nets}
\end{figure}


We observed significant lichen network structure. This structure
varied among genotypes (Fig.~\ref{fig:geno_nets}) and lichen species
varied in their importance in the network. \textit{Candaleriella
  subdeflexa} was generally the most central species (i.e. being the
most highly connected) having the highest average centrality (0.73),
followed by \textit{Ca. holocarpa} (0.54) and \textit{L. hageni}
(0.40). The centralization of the remaining species were \textit{R.}
sp. (0.18), \textit{X. galericulata} (0.14), \textit{P. melanchra}
(0.08), \textit{X. montana} (0.06) and \textit{Ph. undulata}
(0.02). \textit{Physcia adscendens} was generally not connected to
other species in the networks and had a centralization score of zero.

  the ordinated networks with tree bark roughness (BR), percent cover

\label{fig:cn_ch_plot}
\end{figure}


\textbf{LJL: It seems to me that the first two sentences here are the
  most important of the results. How can you make them stand out more?
  Maybe also they should go at the begining of the previous paragrpah,
  and then move that paragraph to being the first in the REsults
  section.}

Lichen networks observed on trees of the same genotype tended to be
similar in structure. Tree genotype significantly predicted the
similarity of lichen interaction networks (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.33795,
F 12 = 2.5379, $p$-value = 0.0050) (Fig.~\ref{fig:cn_ch_plot}). Bark
roughness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.040, $F_1$ = 4.1680, $p$-value =
0.03770) and lichen species richness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.424, $F_1$ =
44.5034, $p$-value = 9.999e-05) were significant predictors of lichen
network similarity, while total lichen cover was a weak, marginally
significant predictor (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.032, $F_1$ = 3.3573,
$p$-value = 0.06779). However, after controlling for the effect of
tree genotype on lichen network similarity, only species richness was
a significant predictor of lichen network similarity (PerMANOVA $R^2$
= 0.300, $F_1$ = 33.3755, $p$-value = 0.00001), and neither bark
roughness (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.019, $F_1$ = 2.0858, $p$-value =
0.14699) nor lichen cover (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.019, $F_1$ = 2.1504,
$p$-value = 0.14409) were significant predictors (Supplementary
Tables~\ref{tab:cn_ng_perm} and ~\ref{tab:cn_perm}). Community
similarity was not correlated with network similarity (Mantel Spearman
$\rho$ = 0.092, $p$-value = 0.09500).

  ($\frac{x - \bar{x}}{\sigma}$).}
\label{fig:cn_metrics}
\end{figure}


The observed genotypic patterns of network similarity could be
summarized by several network metrics. The number of links (PerMANOVA
$R^2$ = 0.392, F 1 = 72.4348, $p$-value = 0.001) and network
centrality (PerMANOVA $R^2$ = 0.309, F 1 = 57.0440, $p$-value = 0.001)
were highly correlated with network similarity.  Tree genotype
significantly predicted network centrality (REML $R^2$ = 0.202, RLRT =
2.7801, $p$-value = 0.04012) but marginally predicted the number of
links (REML $R^2$ = 0.170, RLRT = 2.0484, $p$-value = 0.065)
(Fig.~\ref{fig:cn_metrics}). Total cover was correlated with the
number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ = 6.867, $p$-value = 0.0114) and
centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 8.093, $p$-value = 0.0063). Lichen species
richness was also correlated with the number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ =
29.436, $p$-value = 0.000015) and centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 39.488,
$p$-value < 0.000001). Bark roughness, however, did not significantly
predict either the number of links (ANOVA $F_1$ = 2.897, $p$-value =
0.0946) or the centrality (ANOVA $F_1$ = 2.591, $p$-value = 0.1134) of
lichen networks (Supplementary Tables~\ref{tab:L_aov} and
~\ref{tab:cen_aov}).

\section*{Discussion}

\textbf{LJL:  
I’m not sure about saying roughnes partially explained. Its
correlation went away after controlling for genotype. Doesn’t that
mean that the correlation is related to something else that is
associated with genotype, and not roughness per se?

I have bark condensed tannin data that might be interesting to explore
as a mechanism.  I could also measure pH on the bark pieces that I
have. I think you collected them awhile ago and they have been air
dried, so pH should be fine to meausre. pH is often correlated to bark
texture in epiphyte studies, so it might be driving things.}

Our study provides a window into the genetic underpinnings of an
ecological network. We observed significant lichen interaction
structure that varied among genotypes of a foundation tree species,
narrowleaf cottonwood (\textit{P. angustifolia}). We found that a
genetically based trait, bark roughness, partially explained the
variation in lichen interaction networks. Some of this variation in
lichen networks was related to both the overall abundance and species
richness of lichen; though, statistically controlling for the effect
of genotype on these variables indicates that a significant portion of
the variance in lichen species richness is due to a factor other than
tree genotype. By using network metrics, we were also able to probe
for specific characteristics of how these networks were responding to
tree genotype. We found that both number of links and the
centralization of the networks were highly correlated with network
similarity and that tree genotype significantly predicted network
centrality but only marginally predicted the number of network
links. This latter result could be due to the relationship between
species richness and the number of links in the network, which were
significanlty correlated with each other. We also found that bark
roughness did not significantly predict either the number of links or
the centrality of lichen networks, suggesting that bark roughness has
some other effect on the structure of the lichen networks. Taken
together, these findings support the hypothesis that genotypic
variation in a foundation species contributes to the structure of a
network of interacting species.

\textbf{LJL: 
I wonder if you need to have so much on richness here. 

Overall, I think you want to focus on the network reponses and
patterns among genotype first, and then go into mechanism later. I
think we don’t quite have a good mechanism yet so I don’t think it
needs to come up in the first paragrpah of the discussion.}



These findings point to the importance of understanding the community
level effects of genetic variation and highlights the potential for
indirect effects of genetic variation to propagate through networks of
interacting species and trophic levels. This work corroborates
previous findings of the importance of plant genetics in shaping
community structure and ecosystem processes
\cite{Whitham2006a}. Altering the structure of interaction networks
presents a means for genetic effects to be magnified within the system
of interacting species. For example, \citep{Keith2017} showed that the
genetics based interactions of aphid resistant and aphid susceptible
trees resulted in different interaction networks of their associated
arthropod communities composed of 139 species. At the scale of
ecosystems, trophic networks or food webs direct and control the rates
of energy and nutrient flux \cite{Borgatti2006}. Furthermore, in a
predator-prey-plant study, Smith \cite{Smith2011}, showed that the
interactions among species across trophic levels depended on plant
genotype.

\textbf{LJL:  
It could be useful to point out that our findings are
  not related to trophic interactions, which is pretty cool.

Also,we talk about interaction networks but it is not clear to me if
the interactions tend to be positive or negative. Can we get at that
with the approach used? }



\textbf{TGW: might be good to cite papers on competition in lichens or
  other organizing factors to back up the least expected statement.
  as epiphytes we might not expect them to care.}

\textbf{TGW: I think we need to emphasize the long-term nature of our
  common garden study as very few common garden studies of lichens
  likely exist. Any refs on this? If true might want to mention this
  up front in intro.}

\textbf{MKL: Environmental filtering is evidenced by species richness,
  but also possibly species interaction varying based on environment
  as networks varied in terms of sign and magnitude as well.}

\textbf{MKL: The effect of bark roughness on network similarity was
  primarily genetically based, and there are likely other factors at
  play.}

\textbf{Discussion of network implications for stability with genetics.}

Although our study was conducted with a community of lichens, these
results should be generalized to other groups of diverse organisms
around the world that also exhibit significant genetic signals at the
community level \cite{Rowntree2011, Whitham2012}. In the face of the
high degree of complexity and potential context dependency of
ecological processes, the current study points to the utility of
considering the spatial and temporal scales of interactions, as
discussed to some in previous studies \cite{Bangert2006, Zook2010,
  Zytynska2012}. In the present study, we found that community
assembly processes, such as environmental filtering and species
interactions, are genetically based. This is likely due, in part, to
the large difference in the differences in size and longevity of the
lichen and cottonwood individuals with the trees determining the
environment in which the lichen occur. We suggest that future work
would be aided by determining these modules within the biotic
community that include species with similar differences in body-size
and time-scales. As heritable variation is the raw material for
natural selection to act upon, a genetic basis for interaction network
structure indicates evolutionary dynamics should be considered at the
community level and that conserving genetic variation is important to
consider in efforts to restore or preserve complex species
interactions and their associated ecosystem functions
\cite{Evans2013}.  With such findings, it appears that we are closer
to understanding the evolutionary drivers of Darwin's entangled bank
and the interconnectedness of species in complex communities.
